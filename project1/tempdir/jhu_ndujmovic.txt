						30 Ways in 30 Days to Redesign Your Life and Travel the World

						
						
							 Let&#8217;s face it, if money was no issue, you&#8217;d already be traveling.  In fact, if you have a passport, a clean change of clothes and a dream destination, you already have everything you need to travel.  The problem is, of course, what happens after your Visa gets shut off, you have no more cash and your boss fires you for not showing up to work.  Obviously, you need a better plan than hopping the next flight to Toyko.
This September and October, I&#8217;ll help you build that plan.

I&#8217;ll be posting the practical, real world steps you need to take to get from wherever you are, to exactly where you want to be.  I&#8217;ll be talking about dealing with debt and financial obligations, finding remote work, deciding whether to store or sell, saving for travel and everything else it takes to make long term world travel a reality.
But I need your help.  I&#8217;m looking for the toughest dilemmas: give me your real world scenarios and I&#8217;ll attempt to address as many of them as possible.  Post your story in the comments below or contact me directly at christine.gilbert@gmail.com.
Also be sure to bookmark this page, as I&#8217;ll be updating here with links to each post as they are posted.
What would it take for you to redesign your life and travel the world?

							 Christine, I&#8217;ll be very interested to read your series. As someone who sold house, car, etc. to travel for 13 months - with a one-year-old in tow -  I can attest to the fact that traveling is possible for anyone who wants to make it happen.
I know for us one of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to find appropriate &amp; affordable places to live - when you&#8217;re traveling with a little one you need to have a place that isn&#8217;t too dirty, noisy, or unsafe. We failed that test big time on our first stop.

							 Biggest dilemmas:  1) how to travel/get work/do the things you are talking about for a shorter amt of time (say, the summer or a few months).  not only is traveling constantly tiring, but not necessarily what i want, although i love travel.  2) convincing family/friends that this would be a good idea.  yeah, you have to do what is right for you, but when my husband won&#8217;t come along, i can&#8217;t travel the world indefinitely.  how could i do so for a period of time and support myself too (sort of connected to #1).  And how about just in general, how find work to work remotely all the time so that i am free to travel when all the cool deals come up!!

							 Christine:
I saw your post  and am excited to read more on your series. I am a tour director in the DC area. It is a very seasonal job and don&#8217;t seem to have enough money or get jobs outside of the DC area. All my money seems to go to food and bills. I am taking AWAI&#8217;s travel writing course and would like to be traveling more so that I can have more to write about so that I can get paid for those articles so that I can travel more.

							 Hi Christine, Several months ago I decided to open a vacation saver account with my credit union and put away a little each week  and adage &#8220;out of sight, out of mind&#8221; is more than true! With my first major trip I&#8217;m planning to go to Italy in late 2010 so I picked my target date, counted back to number of weeks, got out my calculator and found my weekly dollar amount and away it goes bye bye week by week! In the short time already my airfare target is already put away and now have a year and half for the rest of my financial needs.
Looking forward to your tips, thanks

							 The biggest issue for me is visas. Leaving a country every 30, 60 or 90 days is a little too nomadic for me. I want to get a little more established and comfortable in the places I visit. It would be great to be able to get 6 month or 1 year visas, but unfortunately it is not that easy yet.

							 Hi Christine ~
Great idea for a post &#8230; thank you!
My two issues:
1) I tried to convince my present employer to let me work remotely. They are convinced that &#8220;in this global world&#8221; it is more important than ever that I am &#8220;physically in the office.&#8221; I&#8217;ve gone to part time to build up a portfolio that I can use to go 100% freelance. But I don&#8217;t just want to &#8220;live&#8221; &#8230; I want to be able to put money away for retirement so I can live comfortably forever. So &#8230; how do I convince my employer that &#8220;in this global world&#8221; more and more people are working remotely? And &#8230; how can I not only live, but save?
2) I know you have pets. I have four pets of my own (two senior dogs, two adult cats). I want to travel extensively, but I am such a softy at adopting older and special needs pets who would live their lives out in animal shelters if I didn&#8217;t adopt them. Do I have to choose between long-term travel and my animals?
I look forward to your series Christine!

							 I am definitely looking forward to the information. Here are some of the things we are struggling with right now - because we really want to be able to travel and work anywhere.
1) we have a house, not yet paid off. We&#8217;re not really in a seller&#8217;s market. We&#8217;d still sell, but are concerned no one will buy and we&#8217;re still paying a mortgage while traveling. Renting might work, but overseeing that from afar is still challenging. We don&#8217;t have family or very close friends here that we could entrust with the day-to-day landlord type duties.
2) I have a location independent job, though so far it doesn&#8217;t pay a whole lot. My husband has a desk job. He could move it to be location independent but due to the nature of his career he&#8217;d have to cover some large liability insurance coverage which isn&#8217;t all that affordable. So, he needs options. Well, we both need options so we can make more money. We aren&#8217;t afraid to live on a budget, but we don&#8217;t intent to live in hostels, etc.
3) At this point (we&#8217;re both over 30, my husband is almost 40) we can&#8217;t just not ave for retirement. So, we&#8217;ve got to bring in enough money to pay day-to-day stuff AND save. Working hard is okay. But, still clocking 40-60 hours a week in a foreign country is not exactly our dream.
4) We have a 1 year old Lab. Your post on Matador about taking your dog overseas is not showing up anymore. Plus, loud trucks spook her so we&#8217;re pretty concerned about what an airplane trip might do to her (to the point we&#8217;re seriously considering taking a ship if we ever take her overseas.). 
I think that&#8217;s enough questions. Our main issue right now is just funding our start-up costs. We&#8217;d like to focus on RV travel in the US with occasional international trips. Problem is, we need a new RV first as our is getting pretty worn. Big investment, which we can afford sometime next year probably. I think our main issue is just dealing with the waiting time until we can finance what we need to finance to make this happen.

							 The biggest problem that my wife and I have had in planning our trip is health insurance.  As we found out by talking with a benefits specialist as we were planning on resigning from your jobs, and the employer provided benefits, the critical aspect here in the US is maintaining &#8220;credible coverage&#8221;.  In most states you can not have a gap of more than 1-2 months before it is EXTREMELY difficult to then get personal health care policies without significant restrictions and exclusions on preexisting conditions.  World Nomads and many of the other popular travel insurance companies are not underwritten here in the US and are not considered credible.  
The solution we found was to move our permanent address to New Jersey while we are traveling so that we can get a basic Horizon Blue Cross plan that we will never actually use but it ensures we maintain credible coverage.  All in all health insurance for Americans while traveling and when you return is INCREDIBLY complicated and expensive. Any insight here would be great.

							 i&#8217;m a travel person by nature. and i married the love of my life but we grew up quite differently. it was a freakin haystorm to convince him that i did not want to buy a house and settle down when we got married in 2007. we both work corporate jobs and they provide for a pretty comfortable lifestyle. my issues are: how do you deal with convincing a person who has come to appreciate travel (because of me), but is very satisfied with the routine that corporate life offers? I know that I could travel without my husband but at the end of the day - I love traveling with him. I love experiencing the world through his eyes as well as my own because it is so rewarding. Also if push come to shove (and he doesn&#8217;t want to go everywhere I do), how do you deal with convincing your husband that taking a vacation by yourself to a country isn&#8217;t a random thing to do?

							 The money issue and job issue weren&#8217;t that hard for us because we are savers by nature and my husband has been working remotely for the last 5 years.  Both of us have also developed enough contacts while working full-time to get contracting gigs on the road.  
By far, the very hardest part about long-term travel for us is leaving our dogs behind.  We&#8217;ve worked this out by splitting up our trip into segments so that we will come back home every 2-3 months so we can check on our dogs.  My parents are going to be watching the dogs and we are going to try to use all the technology we can to be able to see them: we are going to set up at least 1 webcam in their house and also getting GPS tracking collars so that my parents can keep an eye on the dogs while they are at work and also so we can make sure that they don&#8217;t get loose.  I know that you shipped your dogs to Europe so I would be interested in hearing the details of how that worked out.

							 I&#8217;ve been working mostly corporate jobs for the last 15 years. The job I&#8217;m working now is corporate and comfortable financially - I&#8217;m making a good living, about $70k per year. But I feel like my soul is being ripped out of my skin every time I get to the office at 9am. I have a passion for music and art. I&#8217;ve tried teaching guitar lessons, studied audio production, worked for a record company, worked for a nonprofit film festival&#8230;.I simply couldn&#8217;t make ends meet trying to make a living based on my interests. Now, I do Internet Marketing for a software company. It is a conservative company and a remote work agreement is highly highly unlikely. I&#8217;ve been working in Marketing for 15 years. I want to make a comfortable living following my passion for music and/or art. I&#8217;ve read the 4 Hour Work Week&#8230;.I want to travel and don&#8217;t want to be tied to a desk. I am single, never married, no kids.

							 My concerns:
1. VERY ACTIVE 2yr old (how would he do with so much change and frequent flights?)
2. Prescriptions. I have 2 I must fill monthly. Do you buy a years worth and how do you recommend traveling with meds? I&#8217;m sure there is a certain way you must label it so I don&#8217;t get detained in each country

							 I have the fortune to travel for business, and I escape for a day or two in the city or town of the world I have to go. But the last time I traveled for work or leisure was more than two months ago, I went to cartagena : http://www.casablancabyb.com/ and stayed in that hotel who is luxrious, amazing and breathe taking. But I want to go to Colombia for the pleasure of experiencing! there are wonderful places to go down there!

							 Am looking forward to your series Christine.
I left my corporate job in November 2008 and months later I managed to rent my house and also get a &#8220;location independent&#8221; job as a legal consultant. So far I&#8217;ve managed to work remotely from Paris and from the Caribbean&#8230;. but how do I manage if I want to visit more remote places such as Asia? With a 12-hour difference, am not sure it could work as far as work and communicating with my employer&#8230; even if it&#8217;s location independent?
Also I&#8217;ve discovered my love for photography and have now been taking pro images. How do I make money with that, is it a good business to take on the road??
What&#8217;s the best course to take for travel writing - or should we take a course at all?
I&#8217;m curious to read your suggestions for remote work, as I think nowadays it&#8217;s key to have multiple streams of income, to pay the bills but also have extra to splurge while traveling and save for retirement all at once. Is that even possible??

							 Hi, I am 31 years old, and have just had the blinders ripped off.  I&#8217;ve been so afraid of &#8220;what might happen if&#8221; that I&#8217;ve been working for 15 years in a soul-sucking job I hate.  I should have known better, having been raised by an artist, but some things you need to find out for yourself.  Now I have 6000 dollars in credit card debt, am moving to the U.S. to get married to someone slightly more interested in &#8220;things&#8221; and &#8220;gadgets&#8221; than art and travel, and all I want to do is try to support myself enough to make fine art, preferably by making art! I also have a degree in music and have taught privately in the past, so that&#8217;s at least an option for &#8220;day&#8221; job.  How do I pay off my debt without losing the momentum to build this new life?

							 I am retired and that solves some problems but creates others. My wife and I will often travel for a few weeks to a month at a time then return home to &#8220;catch up&#8221; . We often travel/camp in state but sometimes take longer trips also mostlu USA and Canada. I will be looking forward to your posts Thanks Joe Todd

							 Hi Christina. My biggest issue is the financial responsibility at home. I need at least $1000/month for student loan payments, car &amp; home insurance. Aside from that, I would need the money I myself would need to live on. So I guess overall for me, it&#8217;s about money. Thanks! I will definitely be reading your series.

							 Jenn&#8230;I&#8217;m currently traveling for one year and I also take two prescription medication for a chronic disease. I managed to fill all my prescriptions in Canada and  travel with the whole years worth in my pack. I keep them in the original, labeled containers and have had no trouble so far&#8230;fingers crossed! One border official just wanted to see them after passing through xray - that&#8217;s it. Also, I&#8217;m not a very good pill taker but I take them everyday now as I know that everyday makes my pack lighter!!

							 I really look forward to these upcoming posts! My situation is somewhat similar to those listed above me: it&#8217;s student loans. I went to college originally since I was unsure what to do in my life and got a degree in International affairs. I spent a couple years working in the developing world and fell in love with that lifestyle. I wanted to help the developing world out in a certain industry, but didn&#8217;t feel I had the skills myself so I went back to get a new degree. Now, I find myself with the exact skills I wanted to contribute but student loans that must be paid at a salary I can&#8217;t find at the places I want to live. We only get one life and I think must live it the best way we can so I don&#8217;t want to settle, but I&#8217;ve not been sure of the best course of action. I owe those loans, I feel they have given me the education I requested, but I feel that they paradoxically prohibit me from the original reason I got them. I guess I should have put more thought into this, but it&#8217;s frustrating seeing a lot of my (nonAmerican friends) not need to worry about their loans at all unless they&#8217;re at a certain income level or have had college paid for entirely by the state. Any advice you have would be wonderful.

							 The biggest issue for me to travel regularly or for long periods of time is we have animals (a cat, a dog, and 10 chickens) and when we go away I need to hire someone to take care of them and watch the house. That&#8217;s a big expense for us. 
Recently someone asked me spur of the moment to travel for a weekend and I couldn&#8217;t only because I hadn&#8217;t secured someone to watch the animals and I wasn&#8217;t ready for the expense, that&#8217;s it!
I love your blog and I&#8217;ll definately be reading this series!

							 This is very timely for me because my husband and I are trying to decide what to do with our lives.  We know we need a change, but we are torn between (1) quitting our well-paying but soul-sucking jobs, travelling for a year, and trying to figure out what to do with our lives when we get back or (2) staying here, getting new jobs, having kids, and trying to live a happier and more authentic life than we do now.  
Our obstacles:
1.  We just spent 4 years renovating our house.  We are almost finished, relatively speaking.  It seems crazy to sell now, both because we are about to achieve calm from the crazy renovations and because of the market.
2.  Also related to our house - we have to finish it before we sell it and go on the trip, which means many more months of working at our dreaded jobs, instead of finding new jobs now.
3.  At the moment we don&#8217;t want kids, but we don&#8217;t want to wait too long.  If we don&#8217;t go on the trip soon, it means pushing back having kids for longer than I would like.
4.  We are crazy cat people.  Cats don&#8217;t travel like dogs.  I&#8217;m not sure who could take our cat, plus I would miss him like crazy.

							 Any advice for the laborer?
I work a manufacturing posistion and make a decent living, but my work won&#8217;t travel.  Please don&#8217;t tell me to go to college.  If one more person tells me to go to college I&#8217;ll scream.  College can be wonderful for many people, but it is not the path I want to take.  Of course, skipping college doesn&#8217;t seem to provide many location independent options

							 I am in the fortunate position of being able to travel five months out of the year. I just arrived back today from my latest travels. This vacation was a little different. I did a freelance writing gig while I was on the road (not travel related). It was a great experience, and opened my eyes to lots of things that need to be considered when working freelance and traveling.

							 We are a family of 5, the children are 11, 10 and 1 year old.
The main concern for us is not on the financial side (we both work on IT field, we already have some remote contract job), but on the schooling.
Ok, we can homeschool our children: this can work while they are in elementary or middle school, but when they will be in high school age ?
I guess is too difficult to teach them in arguments that we don&#8217;t know very well or at all&#8230;.
So, there is a &#8220;travelling way of life&#8221; compatible with kids in high school age ? I know that Australian folks have a great support from the school system on distance learning, but Australia is not my country&#8230;.
Maybe, for families like mine, could be better leave kids in the normal school, and find location-independent jobs, travelling every time is possible (3 months by year) ?
Here is my dilemma&#8230;

							 Thanks for all the great questions!  Please continue to post, even if you see someone mentioned something similar to yours.  I&#8217;m also receiving emails on this, so I&#8217;ll use the total number of times a particular question comes up to help me determine which things to cover&#8211; since between email and comments I&#8217;m well over 30 potential posts.
Thanks again everyone!

							 I&#8217;m really psyched to read this!
I imagine the main deterrents to people traveling would be 1) money and 2) leaving the security of home, family pets etc. The second one is probably harder to overcome than the first as it involves rearranging your mental perspective and the way you think about life. In truth I think it is possible to travel no matter what stage of life you and your family are in but it probably means redefining what you want your life to look like.
For me right not the biggest issue is the money one. If it weren&#8217;t for that I&#8217;d leave today. Instead I&#8217;m stuck saving here for another year or so&#8230;

							 Before we left people kept saying &#8220;Man I wish I could do that!&#8221;  My reply was always the same: &#8220;You can.&#8221;  Having recently been through the process of getting our ducks in a row to go global (we left our lives in the US in June 09) I know how daunting it can be. A family of 4 can accumulate a lot of stuff!!!
It&#8217;s an awesome idea. Good for you.

							 I&#8217;m 30 years old, single, in debt from school loans, car loans, and a semi-failed business. And now I&#8217;m without a real career. I&#8217;m kind of lost. I suppose that traveling now might not be the best idea, but it also might be the perfect time to sell all my stuff, hit the road and figure out exactly what to do with my life. 
How long is something like this sustainable? Do people live this &#8216;digital nomad&#8217; life for an entire career? Or do most eventually settle down somewhere? Just trying to get ideas.

							 Big dilemma for many: student loans.  It&#8217;s lucky I&#8217;m overseas for work right now, or I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d pay them off.  I know you can do unemployment or economic hardship deferment, but still.  It&#8217;s a big hurdle, and eventually you&#8217;ll have to pay them back.

							 @Tanya, yes I agree with the student loans issue. I had my loans deferred while traveling for a year, (at their suggestion). I called my loan guarantor while preparing for my trip and they advised that if I wouldn&#8217;t be working during the year, effectively $0 income, I should just defer them. This worked for me, as 1/2 were interest subsidized and 1/2 at super low interest rate. I guess this would only work if you have low interest loans (since you&#8217;ll have to pay accruing interest) and aren&#8217;t planning to work while traveling.

							 To travel the world and write about it is my life&#8217;s dream. As I see it, there are two things in my way:
1. School-age children. I can&#8217;t leave them home or take them with me. 
2. Money. I need to be able to generate income while I&#8217;m on the road. 
Solve these two dilemmas, and I&#8217;m gone.

							 Yes, school-age children again. Someone mentioned home schooling them, but that idea scares me, even when it comes to home schooling my 5 year old. For one thing, I am a single parent, so I do not have anybody to share the responsibility with. Also, I&#8217;d be constantly paranoid about whether I am doing it right (the combination of being a perfectionist and placing very high value on education will likely produce this effect).   .

							 I&#8217;m loving reading this and finding the words &#8220;soul-sucking corporate job&#8221; peppered liberally throughout so many posts. Me too! Me too! I&#8217;m 52, single, have grown kids and have no problem renting out my house until the market makes selling more attractive. I also have MS and need helath insurance, big time. I&#8217;m finding the health benfits &#8220;golden handcuffs&#8221; are rapidly becoming a not so &#8220;golden garrotte&#8221;, and I&#8217;m frustrated that that is what keeps me in this job. I&#8217;m willing to budget EVERTYTHING to hit the road, but am overwhelmed by where to even begin with the health insurance issue. Anay help will be most appreciated! Thanks for your blog!

							 I would LOVE to read this! After reading all of the above comments, I can see that a lot of people have the same concerns as me.
One of my main concerns is my pets. I have a cat and a small dog and wouldn&#8217;t want to bring them with me. I supposed I could leave them with my parents&#8230;.
I am also very concerned about health insurance and medications for long-term travel. I have great health insurance through my day job. I do a large amount of freelance work, so while I could likely support myself on that, I wouldn&#8217;t have health care. Not sure how I would manage that, or what I would do about the several medications I&#8217;m on (can you get birth control and things like that abroad?)
Going abroad for several months sounds like a dream, but all of these logistics are eating away at me and preventing me from taking the leap!

							 I have been planning for the past year to get my act together and get a job overseas too - a bit more challenging when you are 50+ and have stuff to get rid of - have debts (student loans and cc debt).  I also have to line everything up in a neat little row to get overseas.  I threw out tons of stuff - but now I am getting down to stuff it is harder to toss out or sell.  In addition the recession is making it more difficult to find work overseas.  A youngster told me to just pack my bags and leave the stuff behind for the landlord to deal with - oh - the optimism of youth!

							 Visas always seem to be a big hurdle, especially if you are wanting to travel throughout Europe in the Schengen Zone. I wish there was a way to stay in the Schengen Zone for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period.
I have a good friend who is picking up and moving to Germany next month. He doesn&#8217;t have a Visa yet, but he figures he has 90 days to figure it out once he gets there.

							 I have most of the same issues lingering around as others&#8230;.but other issues as well
My husband and I want to travel for 1 year around the US with 3 kids and a dog
I am currently homeschooling - cyber schooling my 3 children so I solved this problem  cyber schooling is awesome as there is a teacher on the other end of computer
We sold house that was basically upside down because of the market (my stupidity as well) and now are renting month to month
Bigger issue at present time husband bought car that he is now upside down in  he owes about 9000 more than it is worth  
Our plan is to save enough, kill the major credit issues we created and leave in 1 year&#8230;.the car issue is really holding us back and I guess the self doubt that has hovered over me throughout my life&#8230;.
this blog is really inspirational!!!!

							 Hi,
Well I am a just out of my teens(Actually I will be 23 this year), thankfully with a decent job and good savings with a small problem that I am an Indian. Living like a nomad is one thing I dream about everyday, and yet the physical boundaries make the dreaming a big hassle. 
I have nothing to lose, almost no responsibilities and enough money to atleast kickstart my adventure. What I do not have is that if I do vagabonding even for a year, then how will I get back to the normal daily life and find again a decent job.
Mine seems the best situation from almost all listed above and still I cannot start on the adventure for the fear that what will I be 5 years down the line if I waste one year on myself!!! 
It seems a stupid and yet a valid question, hopefully someone can answer.
p.s Just to get a feel of vagabonding I am going on a solo backpacking trip to Spain for a couple of weeks&#8230; wish me luck!!!

							 Hi Christine!
I&#8217;ve got a few ideas that might work for some people.  If you don&#8217;t mind doing a little work in exchange for free rent, there&#8217;s a publication, The Caretaker Gazette,  that lists available caretaking positions all over the world.  http://www.caretaker.org/
If you&#8217;re looking for a cheap flight, you can try working as an air courier.  I don&#8217;t know how many flights you can get, but it might be worth checking out.  http://www.courier.org/bulletin/
The Web site, Transitions Abroad, has tons of information on working and living abroad.  They&#8217;ve even got a section on health, safety, and INSURANCE abroad.  http://www.transitionsabroad.com/index.shtml
If you&#8217;re single and carefree, what about working on a cruise ship?  They need all kinds of employees, from cooks, bartenders, janitors, engineers, aerobic instructors, dance instructors, massage therapists, hairdressers, actors, singers, musicians, etc.  
As for pets, if you&#8217;re only going to be gone a few weeks, you can hire a pet sitter (works especially well with cats&#8211;the sitter only has to visit every other day to check up on and clean up after the furry ones.  Some will even give medication.  Ask your vet to recommend someone or check out http://www.petsitters.org/.  Just make sure your sitter is bonded.).  If you&#8217;re going to be gone for a while, maybe a friend or relative could take your pet.  I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;d want to take your pet overseas unless you&#8217;re planning to live there for a while.  The quarantine period for animals varies from country to country so it might not be worth it if you&#8217;re only staying a short time or going to be traveling around a lot.  
And for those who love Spain and are native English speakers, I found this site a while ago.  In exchange for your language skills, your meals and accomodations are paid for.  http://www.vaughanvillage.com/index.asp
Hope this gets the ideas flowing.

							 Lived overseas for 14 years but want to escape cubicle land again.Rather than just go off  for years I am inspired by the Tim Ferriss model,he of the four hour work fame.Rent an apartment in a city for three months and explore the city and it&#8217;s surrounds at a calm pace not cramming it all in like some binge tourist.
My situation?Work in cubicle land always one pay check away from being broke,got a mortgage to pay.I am doing MLM and affiliate marketing but with little success.Any suggestions?

							 Andrew,
Well, without knowing too much about your situation, it sounds like your expenses are too high.  Sell the house, get the cheapest apt you can get and save for six months so you can leave.  I think the MLM/online stuff is smart, but that&#8217;s more for maintaining your lifestyle&#8230; it takes a while to build up.  If you want to leave in the next year, the expenses have to be cut.
Cheers!

							 well my plan is to not go away for too long,go for say three months,so  want a home to come back to.I had considered renting the house out but my mortgage is higher than rent I would get on it so we need cash to to make up the shortfall.
For me a business on autopilot a al Tim Ferris is the way to go.
Thanks.

							 I think for many people the dream of travelling the world is better than the actually doing it part. If you truly want to do it, you will find a way. It may take  you 1,2,5, 10 years of planning. It is never too late or you are never too old for travel. 
Dreams are for making come true and the only person that can make them come true  is ourselves. 
The prospect of travelling the world isn’t something that appeals to me. My goal is just to get enough money together  to head back to the Caribbean for another  9 month trip lazing about.

I would like to find collaborative software that is (1) dead simple to use, because that's not what the course is about, and (2) free. Google Docs would do, but students will be sharing code &mdash; plain text &mdash; not RTF or HTML or Word files. Is there such software for plain text?"

			Use subversion either hosted or your own server

		I would recommend to use Subversion. You could setup your own server but there is also hosted solutions available. I searched Google for "hosted source control" and I found this link :http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2005/04/27/Hosted-source-control.aspx [asp.net]The bonus would be to teach your student how to use version control and how to work together on the same files. Subversion (and older CVS) integrate into Eclipse and most other development environment. There is also standalone clients available if your students use a simpler editor like vi or notepad ;-))

		Mercurial would be better for this because both students would have their own repository and no central server would be required.

		Seconded.Well, actually, Git would probably be better, but that's a matter of opinion. But even with a central server, Git is faster and simpler than SVN for most things.

		Well, svn is also quite complex. Compare a git merge with an svn merge.I suppose I should say, easier to use, once you know how. The learning curve might be sharper. On the other hand, it's much easier to set up a Git server than an SVN server -- ssh access is all you need.

		Um, he's doesn't appear to be talking about a repository, but rather, software to enable pair-programming, only with the pair not sitting next to each other (or in the same room).  Say, some software like SubEthaEdit on MacOS X, where two people can simultaneously edit the same document, along with say, Skype or some other voice/video service where the two people can view/interact with each other.At least that's what I gathered from reading TFS.

		I vote for the central server. And for having it in the hands of the teacher.That way he can far better check whether one student does all the work while the other is doing the homework for another class for both of them. Yes, it's also a way to share the burden, but not the way it's meant to be. The server could be made tamper proof and if something's suspicious he could always check the versions and see what was done by what student. Even if they're smart enough to hand both logins to one person and that person fakes doing work as his partner, the IP addresses would give it away if they cheated.

		Uck! Marketroid speak! It's not exactly new, there was a multicast-based text editor as part of the MICE suite, and there were some very nice "whiteboard" programs out there which allowed you to use OLE linking to share data between two applications real-time.The first certainly was around in the early 1990s, the second was around in the mid 90s.EtherPad may be "new" in that it uses HTTP as the underlying protocol, but collaborative editors are ANCIENT. The biggest problem they've faced is that so few people have used them that they have never really maintained critical mass.

(I assume you mean Pair Programming, not just cooperating to solve the tasks.
If you mean the latter, it's just a matter of revision control using SVN or whatever,
which they should do anyway.)

Anyway, one free tool that comes to mind is screen(1) (aka Gnu Screen) in multiuser mode.

		You assume the hardworking student will just let that happen... that's not my experience (i had 4 years of compsci study where every programming course was done in pairs. This was in the late 80's). When one of the pair was slacking, the other one tended to either do the same (and both failed the exercise), or just do everything himself and complain to the assistents about it, generally leaving the other with an F.Uh, no. You really think the hardworking student is going to allow himself to get an F? You forget that our teachers have been exposing kids to this collaborative stuff since 1st grade now, hell, including peer teaching, in which the teacher explains something to the class, and then the smart kids explain it to their not-so-smart friends. They won't complain to their TA, they'll just roll their eyes and do all the work, like they're used to.Speaking from personal experience, teachers love pair programming because it halves the amount of homework they have to grade, and because if you have limited seats in a computer lab, you can squeeze more people in.That said, I actually do like doing pair programming.But pair programming is only useful when both people already know how to program (you're not towing an anchor), but you're doing something complicated enough you're worried about bugs. In my neural nets class, the math was so hairy that Bob Boyer and I really had to go over each line of code in order to make sure it was correct. I don't think either of us would have been able to do it on our own (or at least, not without a lot of pain). Our work's been used in various open source spam filters and referenced in patent applications, so it's pretty cool. =)

		At least it is overrated outside of an educational lab.At least when I was in college, pair programming required two people looking at the screen and no more than one typing at a given time.  You could use GNU screen, vnc, whatever for this, but realistically speaking, it is inefficient and by and large isn't feasible in the real business world after the days of .com ended.At the other end of the spectrum, if you operate in a vacuum, there are definite high penalties of problems being caught later than they should and requiring more rework then they should to acheive the goal.I personally go with a revision control system which emails me the patches the other person does, encourage frequent checkins, and review every change.  I don't have to sit through them typing and reworking their snippets of code as they catch their own mistakes in their own logic flow, and yet I review the changes shortly after they make them and can offer feedback within the hour.  It takes me much less time to review the diff than it does for them to create and 99% of the benefit is still acheived.  It's a very happy medium.  Most any sane revision control system will let you set up checkin hooks to email changes to appropriate distribution lists.

The Python Tutorial¶




Release:2.6

Date:October 15, 2009



Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. Python&#8217;s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available
in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site,
http://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also
contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules,
programs and tools, and additional documentation.
The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types
implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also
suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and
features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python
interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained,
so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
For a description of standard objects and modules, see the Python Library
Reference document. The Python Reference Manual gives a more formal definition
of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding
the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference. There are also several books
covering Python in depth.
This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
Python&#8217;s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
language&#8217;s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and
write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the
various Python library modules described in the Python Library Reference.
The Glossary is also worth going through.

Russia's New Holiday: Programmer's Day



Russia's President Medvedev has decreed a new holiday for the country:Президент России Дмитрий Медведев своим указом установил профессиональный праздник - День программиста, который отмечается 13 сентября, если год високосный - 12 сентября, сообщает пресс-служба главы государства.Неофициально День программиста отмечается в мире уже много лет на 256-й день каждого года. Число 256 выбрано потому, что это количество целых чисел, которое можно выразить с помощью одного восьмиразрядного байта и также это максимальная степень числа 2, которая меньше 365.13 сентября уже давно стало неофициальной праздничной датой для программистов, напомнили в министерстве. Указ об официальном утверждении праздника был подготовлен Минкомсвязи после консультаций с профсоюзами и отраслевыми ассоциациями и внесен в правительство в июле 2009 года.[Via Google Translate: Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev issued a decree established a professional holiday - Day of the programmer, which is celebrated on Sept. 13 if a leap year - September 12, the press office of head of state.Unofficially Programmer's Day celebrated in the world for many years at the 256 th day of each year. The number 256 is chosen because it is the number of integers that can be expressed using a single eight-byte, and also is the maximum degree of 2, which is less than 365.September 13 has long been an informal celebratory date for programmers, recalled in the ministry. Ordinance approval Minkomsvyazi feast was prepared after consultation with trade unions and industry associations and submitted to the Government in July 2009.]Russia leads the way again....Follow me @glynmoody on Twitter or identi.ca.

Obviously the author isn&#39;t a programmer ... I think you me a bit (i.e. 2^8)

Actually, it seems to be Google Translate&#39;s fault: восьмиразрядного means &quot;eight-bit&quot;, and eight-bit byte is correct.  Thanks for pointing it out.

foogybog, there are still 365 days a year. You are confusing count (quantity) with the index (position in array) LOL.

If they had C programmers a couple of millennia ago it would be 2008, but then by now we&#39;d probably be on a different planet, in which case it wouldn&#39;t be 2008 either.

&quot;If they had C programmers a couple of millennia ago it would be 2008&quot;Nah, if they had C programmers a couple of millennia ago, it would now be around 63,100,000,000. :)(Unless they were still stuck with 32-bit arithmetic.)

	 Perl tutorial: Start




 
Perl Tutorial: Start



  Please note: This tutorial was written in the early 1990's
          for version 4 of Perl.  Although it is now significantly out of 
          date, it was a popular source of information for many people over
          many years.  It has therefore been left on-line as part of the 
          historical archive of the Internet.Please also note that
          many of the external hyperlinks no longer function.
  



This is the start of a tutorial on Perl, originally run by me, Nik Silver,
as the first part of a one-day hands-on workshop
at the  School of Computer Studies,
 University of Leeds, in the UK.
The second part of the workshop looked at

designing pages for the World Wide Web
using Perl to deal with buttons and
text boxes to generate custom Web pages on the fly.
Creating a Web page without all these things is a much easier
task. There is information about

how to do this at Leeds
but otherwise you should look at NCSA's definitive

Beginner's Guide to HTML.



There are plenty of other Perl tutorials around, and most (if not all)
of them can be found at the 
UF/NA Perl Archive.
However I
wanted something that included
exercises developing a consistent theme; none of the others seemed to do
this.



This tutorial assumes a very basic knowledge of UNIX and concentrates
on how to write basic working perl programs. It does not explain why
many things are as they are, nor does it draw generalisations about
the language; it is assumed that the reader can make most of these inferences
correctly for themselves. You can find more information on those topics
elsewhere (see above).



This tutorial is available in plain text format on anonymous FTP at

ftp://agora.leeds.ac.uk/scs/doc/. The first file to get is
whole-perl-tutorial.readme which explains what to do about
the main file whole-perl-tutorial.txt.gz.



Thanks to Neil
Bowers whose

Perl page is where I ripped off the camel icon (though he ripped
it off someone before me, of course) and to our Support team for
their technical wizardry.

Computerworld -  

	John Sall doesn't have to work. As one of SAS Institute Inc.'s four co-founders, the 60-year old has a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes' estimate, ranking him the 196th richest person in the world (just ahead of George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Ralph Lauren).  So why does he stay at the Cary, N.C.-based business intelligence giant, 33 years after starting the company with his graduate school professor, James Goodnight, who remains SAS' CEO? "It's always been my job to be a statistical software developer," Sall said in an interview earlier this week in Chicago, where he was in town for a SAS user conference.  "I've invested my life in it. My net value, it's all vapor, tied up in company valuations. It's not real. I don't go out and buy yachts or do other strange stuff. I spend most of my time working," he said.    SAS' John Sall.   Perhaps we can credit Sall's Midwestern roots for his drive. Born and raised in the central Illinois city of Rockford, he earned a history degree at Beloit College in Wisconsin and Northern Illinois University. It was while studying statistics at North Carolina State University that he met Goodnight. Sall was one of the lead developers for SAS during its first decade. But with the launch of the Macintosh in the mid-1980s, Sall got interested in the computer's graphical visualization capabilities. He started working on a data visualization tool called JMP (pronounced "Jump"), an acronym for "John's Macintosh Project."  The software took off with the release of a Windows version in 1994. Out of 250,000 users, most run JMP on Windows, followed by the Mac and a small number on Linux. Its users are primarily research scientists and engineers, as well as manufacturing experts following the Six Sigma methodology. They use JMP to design and record data from experiments, or keep quality control statistics. For instance, most leading semiconductor vendors have long used JMP to help them improve chip yields, said Sall, though he declined to name any of them apart from National Semiconductor Corp. Unlike most similar software that are aimed at helping statisticians display and confirm known trends, JMP is what Sall calls a "discovery" tool that helps researchers see and interpret anomalies. For instance, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA from the tropical breadfruit and determine that the seedless, starchy fruit was created by the deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. Elixir Strings uses JMP to help create its good-sounding, non-breaking guitar strings. This emphasis on discovery is why the celebrity guest speaker at JMP's user conference earlier this week was the journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell, who wrote the popular books Tipping Point and Outliers.  "Journalists are like detectives. A lot of our customers are like that," Sall said. "They don't just want to prove things you already know. That's lawyer stuff. They want to look at statistical outliers and figure out new things." Although still a desktop software product, JMP is so robust today that the latest, version 8, can display graphically millions of rows of data. While JMP's core customer remains those researchers and engineers, the product has in the past several years also been touted for mainstream business users as a front-end for SAS users. An executive vice-president at SAS, Sall remains JMP's chief architect, running a team of 100, including 20 developers -- a sliver of SAS' 11,000-strong workforce. That's fine by him. "SAS makes all of the money. JMP is the fun product," Sall said.

															  IDC White Paper: Linux in a Global Recession
                                                               Economic downturns have a tendency to accelerate emerging technologies, boost the adoption of effective solutions, and punish solutions that are not cost competitive or that are out of synch with industry trends. This IDC White Paper presents the results of an IDC survey of 330 companies in Western Europe, Asia/Pacific and the Americas that measures the receptiveness to Linux and takes into consideration changing views driven by the disruptive economic environment that businesses face today.

Introduction

Up until recently, scripting on the internet was something which very few people even attempted, let alone mastered. Recently though, more and more people have been building their own websites and scripting languages have become more important. Because of this, scripting languages are becomming easier to learn and PHP is one of the easiest and most powerful yet.

What Is PHP?

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is a server-side language. This means that the script is run on your web server, not on the user&#039;s browser, so you do not need to worry about compatibility issues. PHP is relatively new (compared to languages such as Perl (CGI) and Java) but is quickly becomming one of the most popular scripting languages on the internet.

Why PHP?

You may be wondering why you should choose PHP over other languages such as Perl or even why you should learn a scripting language at all. I will deal with learning scripting languages first. Learning a scripting language, or even understanding one, can open up huge new possibilities for your website. Although you can download pre-made scripts from sites like Hotscripts, these will often contain advertising for the author or will not do exactly what you want. With an understanding of a scripting language you can easily edit these scripts to do what you want, or even create your own scripts.

Using scripts on your website allows you to add many new &#039;interactive&#039; features like feedback forms, guestbooks, message boards, counters and even more advanced features like portal systems, content management, advertising managers etc. With these sort of things on your website you will find that it gives a more professional image. As well as this, anyone wanting to work in the site development industry will find that it is much easier to get a job if they know a scripting language.

What Do I Need?

As mentioned earlier, PHP is a server-side scripting language. This means that, although your users will not need to install new software, you web host will need to have PHP set up on their server. It should be listed as part of your package but if you don&#039;t know if it is installed you can find out using the first script in this tutorial. If you server does not support PHP you can ask your web host to install it for you as it is free to download and install. If you need a low cost web host which supports PHP I would recommmend HostRocket.

Writing PHP

Writing PHP on your computer is actually very simple. You don&#039;t need any specail software, except for a text editor (like Notepad in Windows). Run this and you are ready to write your first PHP script.

Declaring PHP

PHP scripts are always enclosed in between two PHP tags. This tells your server to parse the information between them as PHP. The three different forms are as follows:

&lt;?
PHP Code In Here
?&gt;

&lt;?php
PHP Code In Here
php?&gt;

&lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
PHP Code In Here
&lt;/script&gt;

All of these work in exactly the same way but in this tutorial I will be using the first option (&lt;? and ?&gt;). There is no particular reason for this, though, and you can use either of the options. You must remember, though, to start and end your code with the same tag (you can&#039;t start with &lt;? and end with &lt;/script&gt; for example).

Your First Script

The first PHP script you will be writing is very basic. All it will do is print out all the information about PHP on your server. Type the following code into your text editor:

&lt;?
phpinfo();
?&gt;

As you can see this actually just one line of code. It is a standard PHP function called phpinfo which will tell the server to print out a standard table of information giving you information on the setup of the server.

One other thing you should notice in this example is th
at the line ends in a semicolon. This is very important. As with many other scripting and programming languages nearly all lines are ended with a semicolon and if you miss it out you will get an error.

Finishing and Testing Your Script

Now you have finished your script save it as phpinfo.php and upload it to your server in the normal way. Now, using your browser, go the the URL of the script. If it has worked (and if PHP is installed on your server) you should get a huge page full of the information about PHP on your server.

If your script doesn&#039;t work and a blank page displays, you have either mistyped your code or your server does not support this function (although I have not yet found a server that does not). If, instead of a page being displayed, you are prompted to download the file, PHP is not installed on your server and you should either serach for a new web host or ask your current host to install PHP.

It is a good idea to keep this script for future reference.

Part 2

In this part I have introduced you to the basics of writing and running PHP. By this time you should now know if your host supports PHP and should have a basic understanding of how PHP scripts are structured. In part 2 I will show you how to print out information to the browser.

[When the schedule is shot and a game needs to ship, programmers may employ some dirty coding tricks to get the game out the door. In an article originally published in Gamasutra sister publication Game Developer magazine earlier this year, here are nine real-life examples of just that.]


Programmers are often methodical and precise beasts who do their utmost to keep their code clean and pretty. But when the chips are down, the perfectly-planned schedule is shot, and the game needs to ship, &quot;getting it done&quot; can win out over elegance. 

			        									
								
								

            var axel = Math.random();
            var num = axel * 100000000000000000 + "?";
            NS4 = document.layers;
            if (NS4) {origWidth = innerWidth;origHeight = innerHeight;}
            function reDo() {if (innerWidth != origWidth || innerHeight != origHeight) location.reload();}
            if (NS4) onresize = reDo;

In a case like this, a frazzled and overworked programmer is far more likely to ignore best practices, and hack in a less desirable solution to get the game out the door. We have here compiled nine testimonials from working developers, which chronicle times when they weren't quite able to follow the script and had to pull some tricks to save a project.

Shoot Me From My Good Side

Around four years ago I was working as a programmer on a multiplatform PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube release. As development was coming to a close it should come as no surprise that some code hacks started creeping into the game to get the title shipped. The PS2 version in particular had a late, extremely hard-to-track-down issue: A long soak test of the player character standing still in the first level of the game would cause it to periodically crash. Unfortunately, the crash was limited to disc-only retail builds that included no debugging information. With fears of a Sony technical requirement check (TRC) failure looming we worked hard to find a solution. 


To narrow down the issue we continuously rendered a border around the edge of the screen with a different color for different sections of the code. For example, blue represented render setup, and green was the player control update. Because the crash was intermittent, the lead engineer on the title and I would manually burn a bunch of discs and start them up on an array of PS2s. (Keep in mind this was an independent developer, with no IT team or fancy disc burning machines.) The test cycle -- between making a code change, burning discs, deploying, and waiting to whittle down some approximation of where the crash was -- took hours. It was the eleventh hour of development and there was a fixed number of these test cycles we could conduct. 


Between stretches of passing the time over the weekend in the office with World of Warcraft while waiting for a crash, someone noticed that the game didn't crash if you rotated the camera 90 degrees to the right. Initially, the programming team correctly waved this off as some kind of fluke that was masking the underlying bug. This isn't the type of &quot;fix&quot; that would repair the root cause of a crash. That didn't stop us from shipping it though! As we ran out of time, we created the final PS2 disc with a rotated camera at level start -- the other two platforms were already on track -- and submitted everything. The game passed all the platform holders' TRC tests and was shipped to market on time. 


I wouldn't call this a &quot;coding trick,&quot; but it was definitely &quot;dirty.&quot; The mysticism of the fix is disconcerting to this day, but thankfully I never heard of any reported user issues.

Identity Crisis

This scene is familiar to all game developers: It's the day we're sending out the gold candidate for our Xbox 1 game. The whole team is playtesting the game all day long, making sure everything looks good. It's fun, it's solid, it's definitely a go in our minds. 


In the afternoon, we make the last build with the last few game-balancing tweaks, and do one last playthrough session when disaster strikes: The game crashes hard! We all run to our workstations, fire up the debugger, and try to figure out what's going on. It's not something trivial, like an assert, or even something moderately hard to track down, like a divide by zero. It looks like memory is garbage in a few places, but the memory reporting comes out clean. What's going on? 


One dinner and many hours later, our dreams of getting out on time shattered, we manage to track it down to one data file being loaded in with the wrong data. The wrong data? How's that possible? Our resource system boiled down every asset to a 64-bit identifier made out of the CRC32 of the full filename and the CRC32 of all the data contents. That was also our way of collapsing identical resource files into a single one in the game. With tens of thousands of files, and two years of development, we never had a conflict. Never. 


Until now, that is. 


It turns out that one of the innocent tweaks the designers had checked in that afternoon made it so a text file had the exact same filename and data CRC as another resource file, even though they were completely different! 


Our hearts sank to our feet when we recognized the problem. There's no way we could change the resource indexing system in such a short period of time. Even if we pulled an all-nighter, there was no way to know for sure that everything would be stable in the morning. 


Then, as quickly as despair swept over us, we realized how we could fix this on time for the gold candidate release. We opened up the text file responsible for the conflict, added a space at the end, and saved it. We looked at each other with huge grins on our faces and said: 


&quot;Ship it!&quot;

Driving Under the Influence

I've been tasked with taking care of a system dealing with vehicles, which is a fairly major part of our current game. Fortunately, we were able to grab the majority of the code from another studio. Unfortunately, the code isn't always perfect or well written, as is the perception with most code you don't write personally. I happened to find this nice bit of code that was simply trying to get a variable from the engine loop, but was going about it in the most backward way possible (See Listing 1). 


Listing 1: Driving Under the Influence

//************************************************** 
// Function: AGameVehicle::Debug_GetFrameCount 
// 
//! A very hacky method to get the current frame count; the variable is protected. 
//! 
//! \return The current frame number. 
//************************************************** 
UINT AGameVehicle::Debug_GetFrameCount() 
{ 
BYTE* pEngineLoop = (BYTE*)(&amp;GEngineLoop); 
pEngineLoop += sizeof( Array&lt;FLOAT&gt; ) + sizeof( 
DOUBLE ); 
INT iFrameCount = *((INT*)pEngineLoop); 
return iFrameCount; 
}


The funniest part about this chunk of incredibly gross code is that there was a simple function on that object to get the frame count. Even if there weren't, the person who wrote this code could have easily added one himself! Needless to say, this code was not added to my game, nor to the game this code was taken from, as soon as I pointed it out. If this isn't an example of why code reviews are good, I don't know what is.

          That last one reminds me of a time I was on an unrealistically aggressive deadline along with the rest of the team. A producer had a meeting with the client, skillfully freeing up another week of time. I happened to be in on the meeting, and was super relieved to know that we weren't going to kill ourselves trying to get the work out. 

I was just about to tell the team the good news when the producer pulled me aside, and mimed a "shh!" gesture.

The team continued to crunch, none the wiser, until we reached the now fake deadline. After that, the producer acted dissappointed in us, and told us to keep going.

Boy, that producer really knew how to get work out of people who were demoralized and exhausted already! HAH HAH!

          Back on Wing Commander 1 we were getting an exception from our EMM386 memory manager when we exited the game. We'd clear the screen and a single line would print out, something like "EMM386 Memory manager error. Blah blah blah."  We had to ship ASAP.  So I hex edited the error in the memory manager itself to read "Thank you for playing Wing Commander."

          @Dirk: A CRC is a hash which creates a string (in this case used as an identifier).  They were using the data inside the file to compute the hash; as with any hash function, collisions are possible between two sets of data.  However, by adding one space character to the end, they change the data inside the file such that the CRC calculates a completely different hash value.  Thus, the collision was fixed by changing the file in a way that's meaningless to the data inside, but very meaningful to the CRC hash.

          Putting in a space would change the CRC, which was part of the computed identifier for the file.  Change the CRC, remove the conflict.

I feel strangely more human all of a sudden!

As for 'The Programming Antihero" - Well on that one I actually thought *everyone* did that. The real trick when coding solo is to make yourself forget about that array until the very last minute of the project.. ;)

          @Aubrey:
There is a special place in hell for producers that give resources fake deadlines. It's a trick bad producers use to make themselves look good, at the expense of everyone else. In this case, your team suffered so your bad producer could be the hero to the client (and upper management).

Way to cover up for him/her!
Did you like seeing your other team members get extra demoralized and extra exhausted? I guess letting them also be "super relieved" was not your problem. They must have been amazed at your ability to handle the stress of the "unrealistically aggressive" fake deadline. Hopefully that "can-do" attitude got you a promotion.

Good producers work honestly with their team, and they get far more accomplished as a result.
The fake deadline trick tends to only work once (it always gets discovered).
Ever notice that teams miss deadlines for some producers more than others?
Ever wonder why that is? It's all about trust and respect.
HAH HAH!

          Imho, it's good to have multiple deadlines: One for "try to get it done hack-free by then for a small bonus", and another "real deadline that you should hack to meet if-and-only-if absolutely necessary".  The former is based on actual estimates of how long things will take.  The second deadline allows more time to make sure everything is right; it is a safety net.

          +1 on the final story. It's an interesting way to look at things. :)

As some have already mentioned, this is done fairly often with deadlines in quite a few fields. I've not ever seen it done with memory constraints, though!

          This is a brilliant article, though I'm pretty curious what was actually happening in "Velcro Sneaks."

I can see I'll be looking forward to more in the comments, too. ;)

As far as that goes, we were recently having problems where the player avatar would mysteriously disappear and become unresponsive due to the screen clipping against a non-square map.  We found the fix readily enough, but the performance cost was so high, that we ended up just forcing the player to render if they were alive with the comment:
// HACK
// Players should ALWAYS be on screen if they exist.

There were also some related to how we had to implement our own renderer to get half-decent performance, but the real ugly stuff was in the grid optimisation.  We lost about two solid weeks ironing out the bugs in that (which, considering our deadline, was actually about a quarter of the total development time; madness), and we still ended up with another avatar-specific hack so players wouldn't be dropped from the game state if they crossed a grid boundary.  The code for this is still enclosed in
// HACK HACK HACK LOUSY HACK
and
// End of lousy hack.

But I love the trick in "The Programming Antihero"; I think I'm going to start using it. :D

Employees is a little vague though. Need a way of distinguishing between management, account managers, and senior leads (techincal or creative). Unless the producer is insane, those employees aren't given fake deadlines to motivate them. It's only the people underneath the producer, the creative and technical resources, that get abused. Not sure how else to group them.

          My favorite last-minute hack was in the 4-player mode of NitroBike PS2. I couldn't make framerate in one particular level for the life of me; the level design itself resisted occlusion. There was one particular opening in one wall that made proper occluder placement impossible. So I covered the opening with a "wall-of-smoke emitter", i.e. it could be driven through but not seen through. Then I made one big occluder that covered that door and most of the wall. Luckily, it was a movie-set oriented level, so the wall of smoke didn't look particularly unnatural.

          My favourite comes from an N64 game. Rendering all the text in the debug menu was slowing the game to a crawl, making it hard to debug other issues. The number of characters being rendered each frame had to be reduced.

What could be more obvious? Only render every second letter! But alternate, so that on even numbered frames, you render even-numbered letters, and on odd-numbered frames, you render odd-numbered letters!

This leaves you a flickery, but fast and usable, debug menu.

I was as shocked as you, and told my comrades the story behind the producer's back, because I'm a LOOSE CANNON. It was still a hard push, but they were able to pace themselves.

          Whenever you have a CRC collision, you have just "won the lottery". Albeit a lottery that you entered 10,000 times. Or you have a bug in your checksum calculation that caused a loss of resolution. Like a bad mask operation.

          And I was thinking that only newbies like me shipped those horrendous code... :P

At university there was a team (not related to me, but these guys are the perfect example :P) that made a FPS flash game...

For some bizarre reason, the programmer instead of checking if you was colliding with the wall and not allow you go there, he made the inverse, he checked if there was a wall, and allowed you to move parallel to it...

This sparked a bizarre bug: In crossings, you could not actually cross, only turn to the passage on your left or right.

The deadline was closing, and they had no idea on how to fix it...

Then the team writer fixed the issue! He told the artist to draw a animation of hands touching the walls, and then he wrote in the story that the protagonist was blind and needed to touch the walls to know where he was going.

          Working on a basketball game for Genesis. Its used a flash chip to store game data. Game was tested for months and everything was ready so publisher ordered 250'000 copies of the genesis cart. BUT no one for months had reset the flash chips on the test carts to make sure the flash init routines worked correctly or ordered a few hundred carts just for testing..  


Turned out the flash init code was dead and the carts could not save games properly!!! Studio went into meltdown trying to figure out how to ship 250'000 broken carts. Suggestions of production lines adding extra resistors and other hacks to every cart were tried and failed , then some figured out if you played some games in a weird order the flash memory would sort of work.  So i extra leaflet was added to every box explaining how to use this "feature".

          Using the art team and test team as in "Velcro Sneaks" may sound like a cool stalling tactic, is really just a waste of their time.  I'm sorry to hear you worked in a place where you couldn't deal honestly with your management or colleagues.  I also wonder what issues went undiscovered (and therefore unresolved) because the testers were playing musical chairs with bogus bugs.

          Very nice and funny article...BUT...I wonder why, in the "The Programming Antihero" story, none of the programmers ever had a look at the map-file and inspected code-,bss- etc. sizes. The static 2MB buffer would have been "discovered" very soon.
Yes, of course...if you are in need of many megabytes of memory, inspecting the code-size is definitely not the most obvious thing to do ;) but, at least for console/handheld-projects, it is somewhat of a standard procedure.
I have found similar (but unintended) stuff in earlier projects while inspecting the map-file once in a while.

          A couple examples from my past:

------

Don't know how many remember Force 21, but it was an early 3D RTS which used a follow cam to observe your current platoon.  Towards the end of the project we had a strange bug where the camera would stop following the platoon -- it would just stay where it was while your platoon moved on and nothing would budge it.  The apparent cause was random because we couldn't find a decent repro case. Until, finally, one of the testers noticed that it happened more often when an air strike occurred near your vehicles.  Using that info I was able to track it down. 

Because the camera was using velocity and acceleration and was collidable, I derived it from our PhysicalObject class, which had those characteristics.  It also had another characteristic: PhysicalObjects could take damage. The air strikes did enough damage in a large enough radius that they were quite literally "killing" the camera.

I did fix the bug by ensuring that cameras couldn't take damage, but just to be sure, I boosted their armor and hit points to ridiculous levels. I believe I can safely say we had the toughest camera in any game.

------

When I was a lead on R6 Lockdown PS2, I also used the "The Programming Antihero" trick -- whenever an engineer found a significant memory savings I told them to release enough to get the game under budget for the time being, but hold some back for the eventual future overrun. In the end we had a 1-2K buffer (IIRC) that we released just before ship. Most of the team never knew.

          I was one of a few interns at IMAGIC in 1982-83. We were all doing Intellivision carts. One of the programmers had to leave to go back to school, and I was chosen to fix the random crash bug in his game. It turned out to be a stack overflow in the timer interrupt handler. Since the only reason for the handler was to update the *display* of the on-screen timer, I added some code to test the depth of the stack at the beginning of the interrupt routine. If we were in danger of overflowing the stack, return without doing anything. Since the handler was called multiple times per second, the player never noticed, and the crash was fixed.

          There are a lot of great stories here, but the two nicest bits that stick in my mind are Ken Demarest's WC "fix" and Mick West's closing sentiments: 'If you go to the doctor and tell him "it hurts when I do this," then you expect him to find out why it hurts, and to fix that'. Right on!

          From the 'All Signs Point to "No-No"' section: "So, I did the unthinkable -- I packed the controller id into the pointer parameter."
Well, this is basically what Microsoft uses as their WPARAM and HPARAM in WinProc, so it wasn't that bad =)

@Evan Bell: I am a programmer in the healthcare industry and hit that lottery once some years ago. I had to load a text file with over 100k lines, one per medicine, and two lines gave the same CRC32. Fortunately the update routine was run in our server and the clash was easily found. For two files with the same CRC32, check http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/585925

Although not game derived, I got a couple to share. Around 5 years ago we had to change the L&F of the application. That included switching menus over, changing background images, reshaping controls, etc. It went pretty well (at 16 hours per day, took us just a week). However, testers complained that the application started to randomly crash after some time of use, with an out of memory error. Just 4 hours before shipping we discovered the error: the new rounded buttons didn't free the normal/pushed bitmaps correctly, eating memory every time they appeared on screen. So we had to remove the new buttons, and shipped a Mac-like rounded application with gray square buttons.

Regarding fake deadlines, we once decided to fulfill it. Indeed, we reached it, had the product uploaded to our servers, fully tested and waiting for the approval of the CEO to be released. But he decided not to launch it. The thing was that he had put a very impossible goal so that we would be forced to delay the package, giving him time to suggest more features before the real launch date arrived.

Also, whenever the physician chose a drug, it would be stored into the database, linked to the patient and a recipe within a visit. However, one of the programmers really messed up and, instead of storing the NDC (national drug code as set by the FDA), he stored the drug index in the drug database. The drug database was usually modified once per month (removing drugs that had expired, adding new drugs alphabetically, etc) so that, when I checked, the IDs in our database were usually pointing to drugs that were not the chosen ones. Even though the contraindication check used names instead of 
NDC (which made the routine work still), it was too risky to have random numbers as medicine codes, so we had to clean them up. None of them was salvageable, and I had to wipe out the entire column, but there was no way to explain that to the users without making them think they were in great risk. So, I placed a progress bar that lasted around 7 minutes with something like "Upgrading drug information" which did nothing at all, and notified the user that he would be forced to relink some (all!) of the medicines in the program database with the ones from the medicine database as he starts reusing them. None of the doctors complained, though, and everything has been going smooth since then.

Chris Kirby's one reminds me of a couple. A programmer had just installed a spell checker into our program, with the ability to add your own custom words, and he started testing with words like a**, f*ck, and similar. Unfortunately, he didn't clear the table and we got angry calls from one doctor who was showing his secretary the new spell checking functionality when f*ck popped up. So, always clear your databases before shipping the product!

Great feature! I look forward to "Dirty Coding Tricks II"!

          I for security decided to make my game pop a dialog box for every single error possible to happen, even if the error was actually impossible... But even the "impossible" errors, in fact were possible in circunstances unknown to me in a change of 1 in 1000000000000000 or something like that...

One of the "impossible" errors were: "OH MY GOD, THE GAME IS TOTALLY FUCKED AND THE WORLD WILL EXPLODE BECAUSE SOME IMPOSSIBLE SHIT HAPPENED AND ACTIVATED THE IMPROBABILITY DRIVE CAUSING A TIME PARADOX THAT WILL SCREW THE UNIVERSE IN ALL FUCKING SEXUAL POSITIONS POSSIBLE"

After I typed that, I plainly forgot it, it was embedeed deeply in some initialization routines of the API, a code that once done I would never peek at, also it was the only case that I used profanity or that sort of stuff (I am a person that is not much into profanity, but that day was a bad day, so I ranted on that error message).

Unofortunally, one of the testers actually made that error happen... He called me all confused, and me too (since I don't remembered it) and I tought that he was joking, but I searched and actually found it...

Then I had two questions on my head:
How that error happened? (awnser: a mistype that I introduced on the lastest build caused a nasty chain reaction of bugs that made the execution stack go awry, making the impossible actually possible).
Why I did wrote so much profanity? (awnser: In fact I am still wondering the awnser for that...)

          Regarding the CRC problem, it's a common misconception that a 32 bit hash gives you a 1 in 2^32 chance of a collision.  This is only true when comparing a single pair of hash values.  With 10,000 hash values, there are a lot of possible pairings and the probability of a collision is more like 1% (if the hash function delivers a uniform distribution).

          The engine team at Gremlin used to keep a single glove in their office. When someone asked where it was, it was because they were about to type some really dirty code. It wasn't so much a case of not wanting to leave fingerprints as of not wanting to actually touch the dirtiest fixes.

          The CRC problem may also have been due to poor choice of hash function.  My understanding is that CRC functions are primarily designed to check for a data integrity (such as a flipped bit in a network packet) but do not to provide good randomness in your hash values -- for example, very similar files will tend to have similar CRC values, whereas strong hash functions are designed to produce drastically different results even for files that differ by only one insignificant bit.

          I think I know why the guy made the method Debug_GetFrameCount this way. In an interview I got some time ago, the guy asked me how I would access a protected member variable from a class (that was quite an easy question I'd say...). I just answered I'd create a getter method and that's it but when I arrived at my car, I realized you could also access it the same way the guy did it since the class members are set in memory the same way a struct is... 

So this is a way to access private/protected members if there are no getter/setter. 

Now I'm not saying I'd do that but in the case you're working on a program with an API and you only have access to the .h file, you could get around it this way. =)

					What&#039;s the best first language for a programmer?
          For young developers learning programming for the first time, curiosity and enthusiasm are more important than rigor and discipline

					The other day, my friend Ned's cousin asked Ned what he thought was the best first language for new programmers. The cousin didn't have much computing experience, but at 15 years old the future was looming fast, and he thought programming seemed interesting and that it might be something he could get into. "So naturally," Ned explained, "I told him to learn Scheme." [ What's your take on the best first programming language? Join our discussion. | Also on InfoWorld: "My kid could code that." | Cut straight to the key news for technology development and IT management with our once-a-day summary of the top tech news. Subscribe to the InfoWorld Daily newsletter. ] Huh?! Scheme? When Ned first opened up the can o' worms of "which programming language is the best," it seemed like a fine opportunity for an argument, Monty Python style. He'd say Perl, someone else would say C++, a third would counter with Visual Basic, and from there we'd move right on to throwing rolls and upending furniture. But Scheme? This was a bait-and-switch I hadn't expected. Scheme: The Latin of programming? Mind you, Ned isn't alone. Lots of prominent universities include Scheme in their first-year computer science curriculum. Many require it. In fact, I'd venture that if you learned nothing but C++ or Java in your college coursework, you probably went to a bad school; if you learned Scheme, chances are you went to a good one. Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, one of the oldest programming languages still in use. It offers minimal syntax and very few operators. Equally important, Scheme supports the functional programming paradigm, which means it treats programs as the expression of mathematical functions. Any computing problem can be expressed using a unique mathematical notation called the lambda calculus; in a sense, Scheme is merely a parser for programs expressed in lambda calculus.

            What is needed is a simple language that displays a broad enough set of constructs without being overwhelming and within which it is easy to create  visual effects. So the newbie can progress from displaying a simple "hello world" to perhaps playing sounds or moving objects around a screen relatively quickly. Something that's easy to start with but which can grow with them until they have the skills and inclination to move on to something else. Java? Not sure that I'd want to be faced with OO etc. from the outset. I haven't looked at Scheme but from the description I don't think it would have drawn me in. Personally, I have a soft spot for BASIC since that's what I originally learned. From there I migrated to Assembler in order to extend the range of what I wanted to do in BASIC and then a whole raft of other languages, some simply because they looked interesting, and others because there was a need to use them.
Remember, that the aim should be to draw new developers in and give them a taste as to what is possible but without intimidating them.

            Reminds me of my first college programming class.  We used MAD (Michigan Algorithmic Decoder).  I asked the instructor why we didn't use one of the languages used by working engineers (e.g., Fortran).  I'll never forget his answer.  He said the purpose is to teach you how to think and program, not to worry about the various syntactical ins and outs of a language (why was the Fortran input LUN 5 anyway?).  MAD was ideal for that.  Once you've learned that, all the other languages are just syntactical variations.

He was dead on correct.

            You should start with two languages to get a flavor for the different philosophies behind them - say, LISP and PL/1...

            The language really isn't important.  Learning to problem solve and design are more important skills.  Starting to code without the first two skill develops bad habits and makes fixing code very difficult

            Dunno... I started with Fortran, always hated it, graduated to Sys360/Assembly, and loved it (there is something about being able to make the machine do anything it is capable of), raised a family with the earnings of Cobol and Progress. But when I finally had a chance to use Lisp/Scheme, it was almost a religious experience.
All that said, I think I would just give the kid a Linux distro CD, the Linux book and two cheat-sheets from O'Rielly (Regular Expressions & Vi) and tell him to go discover his own language affinity.

            The best, first programming language should have two critical elements:

First, the language must be able to express concepts interesting to the student, reasonably concisely.

Second, the student's teacher or mentor or whatever must be reasonably fluent with those aspects of the language.

Nothing else really matters.

            It seems we always want to sit the student at the easel without taking them through finger painting, first. While I'm quite fond of Python, I'm glad I was exposed to assembler, C and Java first. Now, I wouldn't dwell on those precursors, that's a short path to frustration, for a neophyte. But manually pushing a few bits around gives the student a sense of what is really taking place on a physical and Boolean level. 

Kids like to see how things work. All too often we try to pass them a black box to make our job of teaching easier. It ill serves the student in the long haul.

            Basic is, hands down, the best first language. It hides everything from the student except the logic, which is what they need to understand first. Once they learn to code their logic they can pick any other language and easily learn it.

            I don't know about "hands down," but I certainly agree that has got to be in the top 3.
It's relatively easy to master, VERY easy to read and understand and can do most of what a beginner will want to do - at first.
Beginner is what the "B" stands for!

            I totally agree with mlewis543; a language is just a way to express a solution, within reason, so it's not the salient issue.  Learning a first language tends to stamp an approach on a programmer for a while -- with pluses and minuses -- so I'd say it's probably good to learn a few languages less thoroughly, or a commercially viable one to get a job, and solve problems.  Until you actually have to figure out how to do things in a particular language, you don't know it, formal knowledge and exercises notwithstanding.

            I have a 9 year old daughter and she is learning to program in GameMaker. In my mind it is a great way to get immersed in object oriented programming. You start out having fun and NO syntax. As you get more into it you start learning about inheritance (because it's convenient not because a teacher said that it is important to know). Once you start doing complex things you can go beyond the initial icon driven programming and create scripts. The immediate gratification of incrementally putting programming elements in and seeing what they do is very motivating. And my daughter can show off a functioning video game to her little brother after several hours of work. Personally it's one of the funnest programming environments I have used.

            A programming language is utilitarian, so you need to know languages you can use to good effect.  When employers start requiring Scheme on my resume, then I'll get interested.  At last count, I knew about a dozen programming languages, but my favorite is Ruby:  typeless, flexible, and elegant.

            I don't have a favorite best but there are several candidates for worst.  CLI C++ is one - the mechanics are so horrible that impressionable minds should not be subjected to it. APL or perl (I'm old-school, it's always lower-case to me) also.  None of these three languages is particularly readable.
I learned Basic first, followed by 6502 assembler.  Neither of these is necessarily optimal.  I once thought that the Mac Pascal (for MacOS 6.0) interpreter was nearly ideal for teaching and learning.  Interpreters or good debuggers where you can pause the program and inspect are highly desirable for learning.
I think reading code is a necessary skill, to learn alongside writing it.  A light-weight version of Knuth's Literate Programming could be an interesting learning experience.

            For a first language you need something that allows for some pretty quick successes but is expressive enough that the 15-year old can look at what they've done and be proud enough to share it. Getting props from your peeps goes a long way at that age to plow through the inevitable cognitive barriers (that lead to cognitive leaps).

With that in mind, I'd recommend any of the following:

* Robocode - http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ - this is an environment where you program battle algorithms in Java for a robot. You can then run battles against other robots programmed with other search-and-destroy algorithms. It is the software analog of the "robot wars" hardware battles. Even though it's Java, the focus is on extending a single class (your robot) rather than first dealing with the whole I/O and packaging/deployment distractions. Your first program can be a lot more exciting than "Hello World"!

* Microsoft Robotics Studio R2 Express Edition - http://www.microsoft.com/robotics/ (and click the "Get It" menu) - this is a free environment where you can start with a visual programming environment which allows you to create applications simply by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas and wiring them together. You can then graduate to digging into any of the .NET languages (e.g. VB.NET, C#, and probably F#) to build your own components. It also includes a Visual Simulation Environment powered by the NVIDIA PhysX engine for running game-quality 3D simulations with real-world physics interactions. If the student really gets into this, they can control real robots via WiFi or Bluetooth. There are both kits and plans so you can build your own robots. (I think the Roomba folks are one company which has a hobbyist platform available.)

* For the more Mathematically-minded, I'd go with Mathematica - www.wolfram.com - the student version isn't too pricy ($139). In the more recent versions you can build some pretty neat demonstrations pretty quickly; see http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/topic.html?topic=Kids+%26+Fun&amp;limit=20 for 374 examples aimed especially for Kids. Mathematica is a functional language (similar to Scheme) but it supports other programming styles and has a much richer set of primitives and libraries. In fact, if a 15-year old is interested at all in any of the STEM disciplines this would be the first language I'd learn. (Oh yes, the Wolfram Alpha site - www.wolframalpha.com - is written in Mathematica!)

* Finally, for younger children (or 15-year-olds with a less-analytic artistic bent), I'd suggest Scratch (http://scratch.mit.edu). This environment is meant to produce simple games and artistic animations using the Squeak language which is derived from the LOGO family of languages.

Remember that all technologies are designed to amplify a person's "reach". The user has to have a goal to which they aspire to and then they will be driven to use and learn tools to reach the goal. Tools that are obviously fitted to the goal are most attractive. Tools that allow for early simple successes will draw the person in.

Hope this helps,

Doug

            So many great inputs. It really comes down to the nature of the 15 year old and what they like doing, as well as their own mentality.

I started with Fortran IV, picked up BASIC and some assembler along the way, then moved to Pascal and C, then on to other things in a more dabbling fashion. Mac Pascal was lovely to use to teach with, from the point of view of learning an actual language and trying things out. But there is a lot to be said for problem-solving in English, diagrams (flow charts was a basic part of our Fortran education), and finally with basic algebra (if needed), before moving to a language.

To just play with numbers, do it in Excel with Visual Basic. That could relate back to high school problems of the moment. But playing, exploring and just trying things out is a great way to learn, if there is some reflection with it. Have some fun before it turns into a job!

            My first was BASIC on a PDP8 at college.  I did game programming where I learned modelling and structures and my chemistry/physics/biology laboratory analysis.  The former was for fun, the latter for classwork.  It was simple enough to figure out, often decyphering others' code to see what it did.  Spent many an hour to see what could be done before bouncing the machine.  Eventually I learned Fortran III, took a couple weeks, did not seem like an improvement over BASIC.  Looking back at the old code, I'm embarassed by the lack of quality.  Out of school it was COBOL.  Seemed wordy and inefficient at the time.  Now I see it as a great language for most business and data keeping applications.  Then it was design theory (structured, object, etc.), best thing that I ever learned.  Other languages/tools I use: C, PERL, Java, SQL, POSIX shell, HTML, Javascript to name a few.  Most of these would intimidate a newbie.  I use what is best suited to the task.  Oddly, this attitude seems foreign to the college crowd, but that's another story.

            Scheme (or even Algol) is fine for teaching how to think in terms of algorithms.  Sorry, I haven't been to school in long time, but is assembler still being taught.  Do computer science graduates still have to understand how the machine actually works?  I view the absolutely enormous bloat of today's programming tools and wish for days when memory/storage concerns, instruction execution time, and efficient programming were requirements.  Maybe we wouldn't have to live with the bloated, buggy, slow junk Microsoft has convinced the world is 'state-of-the-art'!

            As a degreed Mechanical Engineer who practiced in Aerospace, I used to look askance at the idea of computer programmers re-casting themselves as software engineers.  I think Mr. MCallister and Mr. De Marco misunderstand true engineering.  The characterization of a civil engineer designing a bridge is an enormous over simplification of the engineering discipline -- portraying it to be more akin to the builder who builds the bridge ... simply following a process, turning the crank, and out comes the product. 

Pure Science is about exploration, research, discovery, new-invention, and perhaps on some level, creation.  Very few folks are actually engaged in pure science regardless of specialty.  Engineering is far more common, as its focus is on product.  Engineering can be considered more "applied science", based on taking the output of pure science and 'applying' it to solve a problem ... through experimentation, inspiration, intuition, etc -- in effect, assembling the building blocks of science in different and creative ways to create something new and useful.

It is true, there are some engineers that sit behind the same desk, run the same programs, and spit out permutations of the same product their entire lives ... but this is not the singular definition of engineering.  Having made the transition from Aerothermodynamics to Software Engineering, I can see that the full spectrum from Scientist, Architect, Engineer, Builder (complete with contractors!) applies equally to the physical world as it does to the e-world.

So yes, just like certain civil or mechanical engineers can turn-the-crank for some projects, some programmers can do the same ... but similarly there is plenty of full-spectrum engineering going on as well.

            The problem with Scheme is that it is too academic not pragmatic enough.

If you want to wander into functional programming language, look at Reol: it is Lisp without parenthesis, it is based on sound foundation see Denotational Semantics http://www.dzone.com/links/denotational_semantics_a_methodology_for_lang...

Syntax is minimalistic so very easy to learn even for non-programmers as it sounds like english, it has OOP with Reflection (http://reboltutorial.com/blog/reflection/), DSL ( http://reboltutorial.com/blog/create-your-own-dsl-for-java-or-c-part-4-a... ) , Visual GUI built upon its own DSL (http://reboltutorial.com/blog/create-rebol-gui/): what more do you need to make programming fun and advanced for a young guy ?

            I think it depends on whether they will be a software programmer (Desktop Software, Operating systems, etc) or a Web Developer/Programmer (Websites, Apps, etc).

The first language I was taught in school was C, then C++ then Java. C was kind of difficult, but once I learned C, C++ was easier to learn. Java was even easier because most of the functions/classes are created for you, unlike the previous two. I ended up loving Java (before I met Python).

I currently use none of those languages. If I was a software programmer, I probably would use them everyday. I am a Front End Developer (with a little dabbling in the back-end). I will say those languages have helped me to understand the foundations of programing. So they made it so much easier to learn Javascript, Actionscript, ASP, PHP, Python and even Perl.

If the person wants to do web development, I would say PHP. If they want to do software programming, I would say C++ first. I say C++ because it is a step up from C but slightly a step down from java in the sense that you have to create some functions/classes/objects yourself and they are not built in. This way they learn how to create them themselves. I never learned C# so I can't comment on it, nor can I say anything about Objective C.

Stay away from Perl and Python. Not that there is anything wrong with them, but because Perl has a high learning curve and can be confusing in the beginning. Python uses tabs to line up its code instead of brackets {}, which can be confusing if you forget and can't figure out why your program is not working. But it can help you to write cleaner code. It also uses list (I think Perl uses them too, I could be wrong) Tuples, Dictionaries and Sets, which from what I remember from all the other languages, they don't use these data types. They are similar to arrays and objects but still different. How to use them and when to use they can be confusing.

            I'm a high school CS teacher, and I use a dialect of Scheme. I don't teach my students "Scheme" per se, but I teach them how to think and solve problems.

I also teach them to write video games in Scheme. Here are links to the curricula I use:

http://www.htdp.org/

http://world.cs.brown.edu/

Strangely enough, before I adopted this curriculum, I had the same complaint. "Scheme is awesome, but it doesn't do any of the cool things students want to do." The people who wrote this curriculum put in the cool stuff.

            Any computing problem can be expressed using a unique mathematical notation called the lambda calculus; in a sense, Scheme is merely a parser for programs expressed in lambda calculus. You should replace &quot;in a sense&quot; with &quot;at its core&quot; to make this true.  Scheme implementations are like anything else you'd use.  Building on top of a solid mathematical foundation is only good for a language; it's a good guarantee against making it a pile of hacks.  And a bad language is much worse than a bad library or a bad editor: it damages the way you think.  This is why people who eventually do get into Scheme or practically any other functional language describe it as a &quot;religious experience&quot; (see Gray_Hair's comment): once you manage to break out of whatever pile of hacks you used, everything starts &quot;feeling right&quot;, and you start to actually enjoy the art of programming, something that you long for.  You just forgot that feeling of programming for the joy of it; you forgot that it's possible to do so without grinding your teeth.  Visual Basic is a good example.  It's one of these pile of hacks, dressed nicely and covered in libraries that let you &quot;do stuff quickly&quot;.  And indeed you can &mdash; to the point !!!
Not so with Scheme, which offers the same terse, predictable syntax for every computing problem.
Still, Scheme? I just couldn't see it. Simplicity and sound computer science are all well and good, but when I was 15, I wasn't really interested in the logic and mathematics that formed the basis of computation.
[...] and I'm sorry to say, &quot;executing algorithms derived from lambda calculus&quot; wasn't high on that list. Video games? Yes. Lambda calculus? Not so much.
But my biggest beef with Scheme remains that it's essentially a write-only language. One program looks pretty much like another.
Its syntax may be simple, but as a side effect, you really have to bore down into the source code of a Scheme program just to figure out what it's trying to do. That makes Scheme an excellent language for teaching programming, but a lousy one for a 15-year-old trying to figure out how to make a computer do stuff on his own.
In other words, no matter how well versed in best practices a programmer might be, programming is as much art as science.
[...] but to pretend that you can &quot;engineer&quot; a software project the same way a civil engineer designs a bridge is simply folly.

It's one of these pile of hacks, dressed nicely and covered in libraries that let you &quot;do stuff quickly&quot;.  And indeed you can &mdash; to the point that you can feed it to a 15 year old kid.  But the whole concept of programming with global variables all over your code, of using butchered OO concepts to &quot;organize&quot; your code, and having no respect to spending some time to design your code (in the sense that refactoring it is extremely difficult) &mdash; all of these mean that after the first day/week/month/year of enjoying it, you start with the teeth grinding.  On the other hand, it is exactly children at young ages that find Scheme so much easier to learn than the adults.  This happens because they never experience the twisted world of VB or C++, and they have no concept of &quot;this is the way things should be&quot; that they need to unlearn.  Moving on from Scheme to other languages is something that will still leave you a better programmer, since you will know and appreciate the true art of programming; even if your canvas is ... uh ... C++ and some Windows framework.
Not so with Scheme, which offers the same terse, predictable syntax for every computing problem. That's the same kind of illusion as the above.  It's true that Scheme doesn't have this kind of feature piling of control structures on top of impossible-to-remember syntax.  But the concepts behind Scheme are really the same as those behind any other language, since eventually it all boils down to programming.  What is predictable is the surface syntax, which is what everyone new to (or unfamiliar with) Scheme sees: &quot;look, it's full of parens!&quot;.  (And Neil certainly looks like he suffers from this too.)
Still, Scheme? I just couldn't see it. Simplicity and sound computer science are all well and good, but when I was 15, I wasn't really interested in the logic and mathematics that formed the basis of computation. Of course you were!  You wanted to program, no?  I'm sure that you weren't interested in learning some boring computer science material, but just learning how to &quot;make the computer do stuff&quot; is what requires you to learn logic and math, it just happens to be that this logic and math is called &quot;programming&quot;.
[...] and I'm sorry to say, &quot;executing algorithms derived from lambda calculus&quot; wasn't high on that list. Video games? Yes. Lambda calculus? Not so much. Try some modern Scheme implementation and you'll find an environment that is just as exciting as anything else, one that allows you to program video games, play with 3d animation, put up some servlets, etc etc etc. In short, it lets you do stuff.  True, it's easy to do lambda calculus stuff in Scheme too.  That doesn't come at the expense of doing anything else in addition.
But my biggest beef with Scheme remains that it's essentially a write-only language. One program looks pretty much like another. Write-only??  I thought that this term was reserved to Perl, where people often point at a bunch of random looking characters and call that &quot;a program&quot;.  But seriously, how is it possible to have a language where all programs look alike?  If they are different programs, then they are different.  But I know how Neil gets to this conclusion: it's what I said above: &quot;look, it's full of parens!&quot;.  If you get blocked at that stage, then you never really know Scheme, and all you see are just parens.  Yet another reason why young children are so much better at learning Scheme, they're not spoiled by some misconceptions about how programs must look.
Its syntax may be simple, but as a side effect, you really have to bore down into the source code of a Scheme program just to figure out what it's trying to do. Huh?  Is there any programming language where you can figure out what something is doing without &quot;boring down into the source code&quot;?  Surely this cannot be the complaint.  So, I'll assume that the real complaint here is that you can't just glance at some code and &quot;get the drift&quot; of what it does.  Hmmm...  How can that be? If you're versed in any language, then that's something that you're pretty much guaranteed to be able to do.  Maybe Java programs look readable to you because you're a C++ programmer?  Or some Python code looks readable because you're a C# programmer? In all of these cases, &quot;mainstream&quot; languages all look very similar, and all suffer from the same fundamental problems. Scheme is different from them, and if all you know is some mainstream language, Scheme will not look too readable to you &mdash; no surprise there.  If all you know is some mainstream language, try to read some Prolog, or some Haskell, or some ML &mdash; they will all look just as unreadable.  (Parens or not.)
In other words, no matter how well versed in best practices a programmer might be, programming is as much art as science. Yes!  And you need to run away from languages that put a barrier between you and your art.  Languages that force you to write 3 lines of boilerplate keywords (&quot;public static void main(String args[])&quot; anyone?) just to get your &quot;Hello World&quot; out the door.  Scheme follows this exact spirit.
[...] but to pretend that you can &quot;engineer&quot; a software project the same way a civil engineer designs a bridge is simply folly. No, it's pretending that it is impossible to design programs which makes the world of software be in the pathetic state that it is.  A civil engineer must do that, and s/he must be responsible for the result.  Civil engineers don't put up EULAs on bridges. If just the idea of putting one up is funny, then how come it's standard practice to shake yourself of any liability when it's coming to your software?

            Hi Neil,

It looks like you are making 3 arguments:

1. When teaching programming to kids, you should keep them interested because that keeps them motivated.

2. Programming is a craft, not a science.

3. Scheme is an esoteric language poorly suited as a first language.

Re #1: Agreed. People listed things like robotics and Squeak. There are also things like How to Design Worlds and How To Design Programs (both are implemented in Scheme, but the fact they use Scheme is not important).

Re #2: Out of scope. Perhaps an entire article belongs to this? It seemed very out of place.

Re #3: You seem to make the assertion that Scheme has no syntax, control structures, one way of doing things, and that you write programs in the lambda calculus. That would really be a nightmare. It is all incorrect, though. You seem to allude to the fact that things have changed (full-fledged comment), but don't go into any detail.

Re: "But my biggest beef with Scheme remains that it's essentially a write-only language. One program looks pretty much like another. Its syntax may be simple, but as a side effect, you really have to bore down into the source code of a Scheme program just to figure out what it's trying to do."

I feel like your message here may not be what you intended. It looks like you just described every language in existence. Additionally, having a simple syntax would address this shortcoming, which of course would make Scheme a better language, at least by this rationale.

Looking forward to your comments.

Best wishes,

Grant Rettke

            Forgive me - all of you - I am not a programmer - not even an IT person - merely an old fart that knows computers - just can't, at this time command them cept by others ..... 

Myself - I suspect DOS is the really best (hope to learn it) - it may be old and sloggish but each command line is firm - would take much more typing(?) to enter a command or create a program(?) - I don't know - trying to find a manual so I can learn(?) it - whatever ..... 

I've sorta checked many of the new languages (which I don't really undertand) - they leave openings for, grin, hackers (nah - I don't want to be one) - wide openings - obvious cause of the many patches MS sends out ..... 

I sometimes wonder if programmers really check their programs (ones using the various languages) - I've had to, manytimes, reformat and reload cause of errors in authorship(?) - whatever, some programs have messed me up - it's irritating - specially cause I don't know programming .....

MS screwed up when they dropped Windows 95 - should have just improved it - gads but I could tell how ..... 

I could go into a diatribe on MS - but I won't - grin - I am still a fan - besides - Gates still owes me $50 (long ago loan) ..... 

Ahhh - memories, computers and I am waking up ..... 

Grin, Not sure I like waking up .....

            One item that seems to be overlooked is the 'top-down' or 'bottom-up' approach of the language.  Personally, the 'top-down' approach seems to be easier because it is the method of English papers, arguments, and conversation in general.  Therefore, BASIC would be a good starter.
The 'bottom-up' approach is diametrically opposed.  You build the functions first and then connect the dots.  Advocates believe that it eliminates many development problems.  It requires a different type (note that I did not say better) of thinking.  
When both types of thinking become second-hand, IMO you become a complete programmer.  Certainly communication is a primary function of a programmer.  Type one languages are easier for 'administrators', 'architects', and other people who control the programmer's life to understand.  There are political implications there that a 15 year-old wouldn't need to understand.  Type two languages seem to proliferate in the academic 'my brain is larger than your brain environment'.  So perhaps the 'favorite' language chosen might be an indication of futures yet to be determined.

            My personal experience has been I learned BASIC (NOT Visual Basic--"Leasco Response IBM Mainframe BASIC) first, at 13 or 14, my listing out a race horse game on our school teletype, reading the code, and figuring out how to change it.

Ironically, my son taught himself Action Script for Adobe Flash at the same age and then he learned Visual Basic at school.

I think the most important thing is to be motivated to learn.  I like BASIC because it is easy to read and understand.  LISP and Prolog are also easy to read, but I found them harder to intuitively understand.  C and C++ and assembly are hard to read (because of their terse syntax), but I found them easy to understand.

            I first programmed in 1971, in assembly and FORTRAN IV on an IBM 1130. Though I worked in college programming for the Dean's Office, I passed my Operating System class Not by copying the prof's LISP much, I was busy getting my BS in beer consumption with a minor in EE. I passed that class by inventing an algorithm to generate "Magic Squares" of Any size. (So algorithms Do Count!) It's been years since I was a serious programmer (HTML doesn't count  ;), but a week ago I decided to get serious with Python. Main reasons included the availability translators into JAVA and optimized C. Hopefully, Neil and I are correct!

            User dstein42 was dead-on to recommend MIT's Scratch. My son created his first "program" when he was 4. He drew a "jelly car" (from an iPhone game) and animated it to run back and forth across the computer screen. Now 5, he more recently drew a pastoral scene with a tree and a beehive, then populated the area around it with yellow dots which he animated to move together in small circles while making a digeridoo sound (closest he could get to a buzz). I don't know where he's going with it, but he's off to a good start.

            Can I suggest Toontalk? It's a videogame-like visual programming environment for both kids even from kindergarten and adults. The owner now gives away the source code for free; I think it nedds a community that takes care of it, does a graphic refreshment (it looks like an '90 game!) and migrates it to Mac and Linux (also for OLPC).

Way back in September 1983, I started my first real job, working at Oranim, a big bread factory in Israel that made something like 100,000 loaves of bread every night in six giant ovens the size of aircraft carriers.
The first time I walked into the bakery I couldn’t believe what a mess it was. The sides of the ovens were yellowing, machines were rusting, there was grease everywhere.
“Is it always this messy?” I asked.
“What? What are you talking about?” the manager said. “We just finished cleaning. This is the cleanest it’s been in weeks.”
Oh boy.
It took me a couple of months of cleaning the bakery every morning before I realized what they meant. In the bakery, clean meant no dough on the machines. Clean meant no fermenting dough in the trash. Clean meant no dough on the floors.
Clean did not mean the paint on the ovens was nice and white. Painting the ovens was something you did every decade, not every day. Clean did not mean no grease. In fact there were a lot of machines that needed to be greased or oiled regularly and a thin layer of clean oil was usually a sign of a machine that had just been cleaned.
The whole concept of clean in the bakery was something you had to learn. To an outsider, it was impossible to walk in and judge whether the place was clean or not. An outsider would never think of looking at the inside surfaces of the dough rounder (a machine that rolls square blocks of dough into balls, shown in the picture at right) to see if they had been scraped clean. An outsider would obsess over the fact that the old oven had discolored panels, because those panels were huge. But a baker couldn’t care less whether the paint on the outside of their oven was starting to turn a little yellow. The bread still tasted just as good.
After two months in the bakery, you learned how to “see” clean.
Code is the same way.
When you start out as a beginning programmer or you try to read code in a new language it all looks equally inscrutable. Until you understand the programming language itself you can’t even see obvious syntactic errors.
During the first phase of learning, you start to recognize the things that we usually refer to as “coding style.” So you start to notice code that doesn’t conform to indentation standards and Oddly-Capitalized variables.
It’s at this point you typically say, “Blistering Barnacles, we’ve got to get some consistent coding conventions around here!” and you spend the next day writing up coding conventions for your team and the next six days arguing about the One True Brace Style and the next three weeks rewriting old code to conform to the One True Brace Style until a manager catches you and screams at you for wasting time on something that can never make money, and you decide that it’s not really a bad thing to only reformat code when you revisit it, so you have about half of a True Brace Style and pretty soon you forget all about that and then you can start obsessing about something else irrelevant to making money like replacing one kind of string class with another kind of string class.
As you get more proficient at writing code in a particular environment, you start to learn to see other things. Things that may be perfectly legal and perfectly OK according to the coding convention, but which make you worry.
For example, in C:

char* dest, src;
This is legal code; it may conform to your coding convention, and it may even be what was intended, but when you’ve had enough experience writing C code, you’ll notice that this declares dest as a char pointer while declaring src as merely a char, and even if this might be what you wanted, it probably isn’t. That code smells a little bit dirty. 
Even more subtle:

if (i != 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo(i);
In this case the code is 100% correct; it conforms to most coding conventions and there’s nothing wrong with it, but the fact that the single-statement body of the ifstatement is not enclosed in braces may be bugging you, because you might be thinking in the back of your head, gosh, somebody might insert another line of code there

if (i != 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar(i);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo(i);
… and forget to add the braces, and thus accidentally make foo(i)unconditional! So when you see blocks of code that aren’t in braces, you might sense just a tiny, wee, soupçon of uncleanliness which makes you uneasy.
OK, so far I’ve mentioned three levels of achievement as a programmer:
1. You don’t know clean from unclean.
2. You have a superficial idea of cleanliness, mostly at the level of conformance to coding conventions.
3. You start to smell subtle hints of uncleanliness beneath the surface and they bug you enough to reach out and fix the code.
There’s an even higher level, though, which is what I really want to talk about:
4. You deliberately architect your code in such a way that your nose for uncleanliness makes your code more likely to be correct.
This is the real art: making robust code by literally inventing conventions that make errors stand out on the screen.
So now I’ll walk you through a little example, and then I’ll show you a general rule you can use for inventing these code-robustness conventions, and in the end it will lead to a defense of a certain type of Hungarian Notation, probably not the type that makes people carsick, though, and a criticism of exceptions in certain circumstances, though probably not the kind of circumstances you find yourself in most of the time. 
But if you’re so convinced that Hungarian Notation is a Bad Thing and that exceptions are the best invention since the chocolate milkshake and you don’t even want to hear any other opinions, well, head on over to Rory’s and read the excellent comix instead; you probably won’t be missing much here anyway; in fact in a minute I’m going to have actual code samples which are likely to put you to sleep even before they get a chance to make you angry. Yep. I think the plan will be to lull you almost completely to sleep and then to sneak the Hungarian=good, Exceptions=bad thing on you when you’re sleepy and not really putting up much of a fight.
An Example

Right. On with the example. Let’s pretend that you’re building some kind of a web-based application, since those seem to be all the rage with the kids these days.
Now, there’s a security vulnerability called the Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability, a.k.a. XSS. I won’t go into the details here: all you have to know is that when you build a web application you have to be careful never to repeat back any strings that the user types into forms.
So for example if you have a web page that says “What is your name?” with an edit box and then submitting that page takes you to another page that says, Hello, Elmer! (assuming the user’s name is Elmer), well, that’s a security vulnerability, because the user could type in all kinds of weird HTML and JavaScript instead of “Elmer” and their weird JavaScript could do narsty things, and now those narsty things appear to come from you, so for example they can read cookies that you put there and forward them on to Dr. Evil’s evil site.
Let’s put it in pseudocode. Imagine that

s = Request("name")
reads input (a POST argument) from the HTML form. If you ever write this code:

Write "Hello, " &amp; Request("name")
your site is already vulnerable to XSS attacks. That’s all it takes.
Instead you have to encode it before you copy it back into the HTML. Encoding it means replacing " with &amp;quot;, replacing &gt; with &amp;gt;, and so forth. So

Write "Hello, " &amp; Encode(Request("name"))
is perfectly safe.
All strings that originate from the user are unsafe. Any unsafe string must not be output without encoding it.
Let’s try to come up with a coding convention that will ensure that if you ever make this mistake, the code will just look wrong. If wrong code, at least, looks wrong, then it has a fighting chance of getting caught by someone working on that code or reviewing that code.
Possible Solution #1
One solution is to encode all strings right away, the minute they come in from the user:

s = Encode(Request("name"))
So our convention says this: if you ever see Request that is not surrounded by Encode, the code must be wrong.
You start to train your eyes to look for naked Requests, because they violate the convention.
That works, in the sense that if you follow this convention you’ll never have a XSS bug, but that’s not necessarily the best architecture. For example maybe you want to store these user strings in a database somewhere, and it doesn’t make sense to have them stored HTML-encoded in the database, because they might have to go somewhere that is not an HTML page, like to a credit card processing application that will get confused if they are HTML-encoded. Most web applications are developed under the principle that all strings internally are not encoded until the very last moment before they are sent to an HTML page, and that’s probably the right architecture.
We really need to be able to keep things around in unsafe format for a while.
OK. I’ll try again. 
Possible Solution #2
What if we made a coding convention that said that when you write out any string you have to encode it?

s = Request("name")// much later:Write Encode(s)
Now whenever you see a naked Write without the Encode you know something is amiss.
Well, that doesn’t quite work… sometimes you have little bits of HTML around in your code and you can’t encode them:

If mode = "linebreak" Then prefix = "&lt;br&gt;"
// much later:Write prefix
This looks wrong according to our convention, which requires us to encode strings on the way out:

Write Encode(prefix)
But now the "&lt;br&gt;", which is supposed to start a new line, gets encoded to &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; and appears to the user as a literal &lt; b r &gt;. That’s not right either.
So, sometimes you can’t encode a string when you read it in, and sometimes you can’t encode it when you write it out, so neither of these proposals works. And without a convention, we’re still running the risk that you do this:

s = Request("name")
...pages later...name = s
...pages later...recordset("name") = name // store name in db in a column "name"
...days later...theName = recordset("name") 
...pages or even months later...Write theName
Did we remember to encode the string? There’s no single place where you can look to see the bug. There’s no place to sniff. If you have a lot of code like this, it takes a ton of detective work to trace the origin of every string that is ever written out to make sure it has been encoded.
The Real Solution
So let me suggest a coding convention that works. We’ll have just one rule:
All strings that come from the user must be stored in variables (or database columns) with a name starting with the prefix "us" (for Unsafe String). All strings that have been HTML encoded or which came from a known-safe location must be stored in variables with a name starting with the prefix "s" (for Safe string).
Let me rewrite that same code, changing nothing but the variable names to match our new convention.

us = Request("name")
...pages later...usName = us
...pages later...recordset("usName") = usName 
...days later...sName = Encode(recordset("usName"))
...pages or even months later...Write sName
The thing I want you to notice about the new convention is that now, if you make a mistake with an unsafe string, you can always see it on some single line of code, as long as the coding convention is adhered to:

s = Request("name")
is a priori wrong, because you see the result of Request being assigned to a variable whose name begins with s, which is against the rules. The result of Request is always unsafe so it must always be assigned to a variable whose name begins with “us”.

us = Request("name")
is always OK.

usName = us
is always OK.

sName = us
is certainly wrong.

sName = Encode(us)
is certainly correct.

Write usName
is certainly wrong.

Write sName
is OK, as is

Write Encode(usName)
Every line of code can be inspected by itself, and if every line of code is correct, the entire body of code is correct.
Eventually, with this coding convention, your eyes learn to see the Write usXXX and know that it’s wrong, and you instantly know how to fix it, too. I know, it’s a little bit hard to see the wrong code at first, but do this for three weeks, and your eyes will adapt, just like the bakery workers who learned to look at a giant bread factory and instantly say, “jay-zuss, nobody cleaned insahd rounduh fo-ah! What the hayl kine a opparashun y’awls runnin' heey-uh?” 
In fact we can extend the rule a bit, and rename (or wrap) the Request and Encodefunctions to be UsRequest and SEncode... in other words, functions that return an unsafe string or a safe string will start with Us and S, just like variables. Now look at the code:

us = UsRequest("name")usName = usrecordset("usName") = usName sName = SEncode(recordset("usName"))Write sName
See what I did? Now you can look to see that both sides of the equal sign start with the same prefix to see mistakes.

us = UsRequest("name") // ok, both sides start with USs = UsRequest("name") // bugusName = us // oksName = us // certainly wrong.sName = SEncode(us) // certainly correct.
Heck, I can take it one step further, by naming Write to WriteS and renaming SEncode to SFromUs:

us = UsRequest("name")usName = usrecordset("usName") = usName sName = SFromUs(recordset("usName"))WriteS sName
This makes mistakes even more visible. Your eyes will learn to “see” smelly code, and this will help you find obscure security bugs just through the normal process of writing code and reading code.
Making wrong code look wrong is nice, but it’s not necessarily the best possible solution to every security problem. It doesn’t catch every possible bug or mistake, because you might not look at every line of code. But it’s sure a heck of a lot better than nothing, and I’d much rather have a coding convention where wrong code, at least, looked wrong. You instantly gain the incremental benefit that every time a programmer’s eyes pass over a line of code, that particular bug is checked for and prevented.
A General Rule
This business of making wrong code look wrong depends on getting the right things close together in one place on the screen. When I’m looking at a string, in order to get the code right, I need to know, everywhere I see that string, whether it’s safe or unsafe. I don’t want that information to be in another file or on another page that I would have to scroll to. I have to be able to see it right there and that means a variable naming convention.
There are a lot of other examples where you can improve code by moving things next to each other. Most coding conventions include rules like:

Keep functions short.
Declare your variables as close as possible to the place where you will use them.
Don’t use macros to create your own personal programming language.
Don’t use goto.
Don’t put closing braces more than one screen away from the matching opening brace.
What all these rules have in common is that they are trying to get the relevant information about what a line of code really does physically as close together as possible. This improves the chances that your eyeballs will be able to figure out everything that’s going on. 
In general, I have to admit that I’m a little bit scared of language features that hide things. When you see the code

i = j * 5;
… in C you know, at least, that j is being multiplied by five and the results stored in i. 
But if you see that same snippet of code in C++, you don’t know anything. Nothing. The only way to know what’s really happening in C++ is to find out what types i and j are, something which might be declared somewhere altogether else. That’s because j might be of a type that has operator* overloaded and it does something terribly witty when you try to multiply it. And i might be of a type that has operator= overloaded, and the types might not be compatible so an automatic type coercion function might end up being called. And the only way to find out is not only to check the type of the variables, but to find the code that implements that type, and God help you if there’s inheritance somewhere, because now you have to traipse all the way up the class hierarchy all by yourself trying to find where that code really is, and if there’s polymorphism somewhere, you’re really in trouble because it’s not enough to know what type i and j are declared, you have to know what type they are right now, which might involve inspecting an arbitrary amount of code and you can never really be sure if you’ve looked everywhere thanks to the halting problem (phew!).
When you see i=j*5 in C++ you are really on your own, bubby, and that, in my mind, reduces the ability to detect possible problems just by looking at code.
None of this was supposed to matter, of course. When you do clever-schoolboy things like override operator*, this is meant to be to help you provide a nice waterproof abstraction. Golly, j is a Unicode String type, and multiplying a Unicode String by an integer is obviously a good abstraction for converting Traditional Chinese to Standard Chinese, right?
The trouble is, of course, that waterproof abstractions aren’t. I’ve already talked about this extensively in The Law of Leaky Abstractions so I won’t repeat myself here.
Scott Meyers has made a whole career out of showing you all the ways they fail and bite you, in C++ at least. (By the way, the third edition of Scott’s book Effective C++ just came out; it’s completely rewritten;&nbsp;get your copy today!)
Okay.
I’m losing track. I better summarize The Story Until Now:

Look for coding conventions that make wrong code look wrong. Getting the right information collocated all together in the same place on screen in your code lets you see certain types of problems and fix them right away.
I’m Hungary
So now we get back to the infamous Hungarian notation.
Hungarian notation was invented by Microsoft programmer Charles Simonyi. One of the major projects Simonyi worked on at Microsoft was Word; in fact he led the project to create the world’s first WYSIWYG word processor, something called Bravo at Xerox Parc.
In WYSIWYG word processing, you have scrollable windows, so every coordinate has to be interpreted as either relative to the window or relative to the page, and that makes a big difference, and keeping them straight is pretty important.
Which, I surmise, is one of the many good reasons Simonyi started using something that came to be called Hungarian notation. It looked like Hungarian, and Simonyi was from Hungary, thus the name. In Simonyi’s version of Hungarian notation, every variable was prefixed with a lower case tag that indicated the kind of thing that the variable contained. 

I’m using the word kind on purpose, there, because Simonyi mistakenly used the word type in his paper, and generations of programmers misunderstood what he meant.
If you read Simonyi’s paper closely, what he was getting at was the same kind of naming convention as I used in my example above where we decided that us meant “unsafe string” and s meant “safe string.” They’re both of type string. The compiler won’t help you if you assign one to the other and Intellisense won’t tell you bupkis. But they are semantically different; they need to be interpreted differently and treated differently and some kind of conversion function will need to be called if you assign one to the other or you will have a runtime bug. If you’re lucky.
Simonyi’s original concept for Hungarian notation was called, inside Microsoft, Apps Hungarian, because it was used in the Applications Division, to wit, Word and Excel. In Excel’s source code you see a lot of rw and col and when you see those you know that they refer to rows and columns. Yep, they’re both integers, but it never makes sense to assign between them. In Word, I'm told, you see a lot of xl and xw, where xl means “horizontal coordinates relative to the layout” and xw means “horizontal coordinates relative to the window.” Both ints. Not interchangeable. In both apps you see a lot of cb meaning “count of bytes.” Yep, it’s an int again, but you know so much more about it just by looking at the variable name. It’s a count of bytes: a buffer size. And if you see xl = cb, well, blow the Bad Code Whistle, that is obviously wrong code, because even though xl and cb are both integers, it’s completely crazy to set a horizontal offset in pixels to a count of bytes.
In Apps Hungarian prefixes are used for functions, as well as variables. So, to tell you the truth, I’ve never seen the Word source code, but I’ll bet you dollars to donuts there’s a function called YlFromYw which converts from vertical window coordinates to vertical layout coordinates. Apps Hungarian requires the notation TypeFromType instead of the more traditional&nbsp;TypeToType so that every function name could begin with the type of thing that it was returning, just like I did earlier in the example when I renamed Encode SFromUs. In fact in proper Apps Hungarian the Encode function would have to be named SFromUs. Apps Hungarian wouldn’t really give you a choice in how to name this function. That’s a good thing, because it’s one less thing you need to remember, and you don’t have to wonder what kind of encoding is being referred to by the word Encode: you have something much more precise.
Apps Hungarian was extremely valuable, especially in the days of C programming where the compiler didn’t provide a very useful type system. 
But then something kind of wrong happened. 
The dark side took over Hungarian Notation.
Nobody seems to know why or how, but it appears that the documentation writers on the Windows team inadvertently invented what came to be known as Systems Hungarian.
Somebody, somewhere, read Simonyi’s paper, where he used the word “type,” and thought he meant type, like class, like in a type system, like the type checking that the compiler does. He did not. He explained very carefully exactly what he meant by the word “type,” but it didn’t help. The damage was done. 
Apps Hungarian had very useful, meaningful prefixes like “ix” to mean an index into an array, “c” to mean a count, “d” to mean the difference between two numbers (for example “dx” meant “width”), and so forth.
Systems Hungarian had far less useful prefixes like “l” for long and “ul” for “unsigned long” and “dw” for double word, which is, actually, uh, an unsigned long. In Systems Hungarian, the only thing that the prefix told you was the actual data type of the variable.
This was a subtle but complete misunderstanding of Simonyi’s intention and practice, and it just goes to show you that if you write convoluted, dense academic prose nobody will understand it and your ideas will be misinterpreted and then the misinterpreted ideas will be ridiculed even when they weren’t your ideas. So in Systems Hungarian you got a lot of dwFoo meaning “double word foo,” and doggone it, the fact that a variable is a double word tells you darn near nothing useful at all. So it’s no wonder people rebelled against Systems Hungarian.
Systems Hungarian was promulgated far and wide; it is the standard throughout the Windows programming documentation; it was spread extensively by books like Charles Petzold’s Programming Windows, the bible for learning Windows programming, and it rapidly became the dominant form of Hungarian, even inside Microsoft, where very few programmers outside the Word and Excel teams understood just what a mistake they had made.
And then came The Great Rebellion. Eventually, programmers who never understood Hungarian in the first place noticed that the misunderstood subset they were using was Pretty Dang Annoying and Well-Nigh Useless, and they revolted against it. Now, there are still some nice qualities in Systems Hungarian, which help you see bugs. At the very least, if you use Systems Hungarian, you’ll know the type of a variable at the spot where you’re using it. But it’s not nearly as valuable as Apps Hungarian.
The Great Rebellion hit its peak with the first release of .NET. Microsoft finally started telling people, “Hungarian Notation Is Not Recommended.” There was much rejoicing. I don’t even think they bothered saying why. They just went through the naming guidelines section of the document and wrote, “Do Not Use Hungarian Notation” in every entry. Hungarian Notation was so doggone unpopular by this point that nobody really complained, and everybody in the world outside of Excel and Word were relieved at no longer having to use an awkward naming convention that, they thought, was unnecessary in the days of strong type checking and Intellisense.
But there’s still a tremendous amount of value to Apps Hungarian, in that it increases collocation in code, which makes the code easier to read, write, debug, and maintain, and, most importantly, it makes wrong code look wrong. 
Before we go, there’s one more thing I promised to do, which is to bash exceptions one more time. The last time I did that I got in a lot of trouble. In an off-the-cuff remark on the Joel on Software homepage, I wrote that I don’t like exceptions because they are, effectively, an invisible goto, which, I reasoned, is even worse than a goto you can see. Of course millions of people jumped down my throat. The only person in the world who leapt to my defense was, of course, Raymond Chen, who is, by the way, the best programmer in the world, so that has to say something, right?
Here’s the thing with exceptions, in the context of this article. Your eyes learn to see wrong things, as long as there is something to see, and this prevents bugs. In order to make code really, really robust, when you code-review it, you need to have coding conventions that allow collocation. In other words, the more information about what code is doing is located right in front of your eyes, the better a job you’ll do at finding the mistakes. When you have code that says

dosomething();cleanup();
… your eyes tell you, what’s wrong with that? We always clean up! But the possibility that dosomething might throw an exception means that cleanupmight not get called. And that’s easily fixable, using finally or whatnot, but that’s not my point: my point is that the only way to know that cleanup is definitely called is to investigate the entire call tree of dosomething to see if there’s anything in there, anywhere, which can throw an exception, and that’s ok, and there are things like checked exceptions to make it less painful, but the real point is that exceptions eliminate collocation. You have to look somewhere else to answer a question of whether code is doing the right thing, so you’re not able to take advantage of your eye’s built-in ability to learn to see wrong code, because there’s nothing to see.
Now, when I’m writing a dinky script to gather up a bunch of data and print it once a day, heck yeah, exceptions are great. I like nothing more than to ignore all possible wrong things that can happen and just wrap up the whole damn program in a big ol’ try/catch that emails me if anything ever goes wrong. Exceptions are fine for quick-and-dirty code, for scripts, and for code that is neither mission critical nor life-sustaining. But if you’re writing an operating system, or a nuclear power plant, or the software to control a high speed circular saw used in open heart surgery, exceptions are extremely dangerous. 
I know people will assume that I’m a lame programmer for failing to understand exceptions properly and failing to understand all the ways they can improve my life if only I was willing to let exceptions into my heart, but, too bad. The way to write really reliable code is to try to use simple tools that take into account typical human frailty, not complex tools with hidden side effects and leaky abstractions that assume an infallible programmer.
More Reading
If you're still all gung-ho about exceptions, read Raymond Chen's essay Cleaner, more elegant, and harder to recognize. "It is extraordinarily difficult to see the difference between bad exception-based code and not-bad exception-based code...&nbsp;exceptions are too hard and I'm not smart enough to handle them."
Raymond's rant about Death by Macros, A rant against flow control macros, is about another case where failing to get information all in the same place makes code unmaintainable. "When you see code that uses [macros], you have to go dig through header files to figure out what they do."
For background on the history of Hungarian notation, start with Simonyi's original paper, Hungarian Notation. Doug Klunder introduced this to the Excel team&nbsp;in a somewhat clearer paper. For more stories about Hungarian and how it got ruined by documentation writers, read Larry Osterman's post, especially Scott Ludwig's comment, or Rick Schaut's post.

We spend a lot of time on this site talking about exciting Big Picture Stuff like .NET versus Java, XML strategy, Lock-In, competitive strategy, software design, architecture, and so forth. All this stuff is a layer cake, in a way. At the top layer, you've got software strategy. Below that, we think about architectures like .NET, and below that, individual products: software development products like Java or platforms like Windows.
Go lower on the cake, please. DLLs? Objects? Functions? No! Lower! At some point you're thinking about lines of code written in programming languages.
Still not low enough. Today I want to think about CPUs. A little bit of silicon moving bytes around. Pretend you are a beginning programmer. Tear away all that knowledge you've built up about programming, software, management, and get back to the lowest level Von Neumann fundamental stuff. Wipe J2EE out of your mind for a moment. Think Bytes.
Why are we doing this? I think that some of the biggest mistakes people make even at the highest architectural levels come from having a weak or broken understanding of a few simple things at the very lowest levels. You've built a marvelous palace but the foundation is a mess.&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;a nice cement slab, you've got rubble down there. So the palace looks nice but occasionally the bathtub slides across the bathroom floor and you have no idea what's going on. 
So today, take a deep breath. Walk with me, please, through a little exercise which will be conducted using the C programming language.
Remember the way strings work in C: they consist of a bunch of bytes followed by a null character, which has the value 0. This has two obvious implications:

There is no way to know where the string ends (that is, the string length)&nbsp;without moving through it, looking for the null character at the end. 
Your string can't have any zeros in it. So you can't store an arbitrary binary blob like a JPEG picture in a C string.
Why do C strings work this way? It's because the PDP-7 microprocessor, on which UNIX and the C programming language were invented, had an ASCIZ string type. ASCIZ meant "ASCII with a Z (zero) at the end."
Is this the only way to store strings? No, in fact, it's one of the worst ways to store strings. For non-trivial programs, APIs, operating systems, class libraries, you should avoid&nbsp;ASCIZ strings like the plague.&nbsp;Why?
Let's start by writing a version of the code for strcat, the function which appends one string to another.
void strcat( char* dest, char* src ){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest) dest++;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest++ = *src++);}
Study the code a bit and see what we're doing here. First, we're walking through the first string looking for its null-terminator. When we find it, we walk through the second string, copying one character at a time onto the first string.
This kind of string handling and string concatenation was good enough for Kernighan and Ritchie, but it has its problems. Here's a problem. Suppose you have a bunch of names that you want to append together in one big string:
char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate... */bigString[0] = '\0';strcat(bigString,"John, ");strcat(bigString,"Paul, ");strcat(bigString,"George, ");strcat(bigString,"Joel ");
This works, right? Yes. And it looks nice and clean.
What is its performance characteristic? Is it as fast as it could be? Does it scale well? If we had a million strings to append, would this be a good way to do it?
No. This code uses the Shlemiel the&nbsp;painter's algorithm. Who is Shlemiel? He's the guy in this joke:

Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter, painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road. On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. "That's pretty good!" says his boss, "you're&nbsp;a fast worker!" and pays him a kopeck.
The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. "Well, that's not nearly as good as yesterday, but you're still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable," and pays him a kopeck.
The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. "Only 30!" shouts his boss. "That's unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What's going on?"
"I can't help it," says Shlemiel. "Every day I get&nbsp;farther and farther away from the paint can!"
(For extra credit, what are the real numbers?) This lame joke illustrates exactly what's going on when you use strcat like I just did. Since the first part of strcat has to scan through the destination string every time, looking for that dang null terminator again and again, this function is much slower than it needs to be and doesn't scale well at all. Lots of code you use every day has this problem. Many file systems are implemented in a way that it's a bad idea to put too many files in one directory, because performance starts to drop off dramatically when you get thousands of items in one directory. Try opening an overstuffed Windows recycle bin to see this in action -- it takes hours to show up, which is clearly not linear in the number of files it contains. There must be a Shlemiel the Painter's Algorithm in there somewhere. Whenever something seems like it should have linear performance but it seems to have n-squared performance, look for hidden Shlemiels. They are often hidden by your libraries. Looking at a column of strcats or a strcat in a loop doesn't exactly shout out "n-squared," but that is what's happening.
How do we fix this? A few smart C programmers implemented their own mystrcat as follows:
char* mystrcat( char* dest, char* src ){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest) dest++;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest++ = *src++);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return --dest;}
What have we done here? At very little extra cost we're returning a pointer to the end of the new, longer string. That way the code that calls this function can decide to append further without rescanning the string:
char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate... */char *p = bigString;bigString[0] = '\0';p = mystrcat(p,"John, ");p = mystrcat(p,"Paul, ");p = mystrcat(p,"George, ");p = mystrcat(p,"Joel ");
This is, of course, linear in performance, not n-squared, so it doesn't suffer from degradation when you have a lot of stuff to concatenate.
The designers of Pascal were aware of this problem and "fixed" it by storing a byte count in the first byte of the string.&nbsp;These are called Pascal Strings. They can contain zeros and are not null terminated. Because a byte can only store numbers between 0 and 255, Pascal strings are limited to 255 bytes in length, but because they are not null terminated they occupy the same amount of memory as ASCIZ strings.&nbsp;The great thing about Pascal strings is that you never have to have a loop just to figure out the length of your string. Finding the length of a string in Pascal is one assembly instruction instead of a whole loop. It is monumentally faster.
The old Macintosh operating system used Pascal strings everywhere. Many C programmers on other platforms used Pascal strings for speed. Excel uses Pascal strings internally which is why strings in many places in Excel are limited to 255 bytes, and it's also one reason Excel is blazingly fast.
For a long time, if you wanted to put a Pascal string literal in your C code, you had to write:
char* str = "\006Hello!";
Yep, you had to count the bytes by hand, yourself, and hardcode it into the first byte of your string. Lazy programmers would do this, and have slow programs:
char* str = "*Hello!";str[0] = strlen(str) - 1;
Notice in this case you've got a string that is null terminated (the compiler did that) as well as a Pascal string. I used to call these fucked strings because it's easier than calling them&nbsp;null terminated pascal strings but this is a rated-G channel so you will have use the longer name.
I elided an important issue earlier. Remember this line of code?
char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate... */
Since we're looking at the bits today I shouldn't have ignored this. I should have done this correctly: figured out how many bytes I needed and allocated the right amount of memory.
Shouldn't I have?
Because otherwise, you see, a clever hacker will read my code and notice that I'm only allocating 1000 bytes and hoping it will be enough, and they'll find some clever way to trick me into strcatting a 1100 byte string into my 1000 bytes of memory, thus overwriting the stack frame and changing the return address so that when this function returns, it executes some code which the hacker himself wrote. This is what they're talking about when they say that a particular program has a buffer overflow susceptibility. It was the number one cause of hacks and worms in the olden days before Microsoft Outlook made hacking easy enough for teenagers to do.
OK, so all those programmers are just lame-asses. They should have figured out how much memory to allocate.
But really, C does not make this easy on you. Let's go back to my Beatles example:
char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate... */char *p = bigString;bigString[0] = '\0';p = mystrcat(p,"John, ");p = mystrcat(p,"Paul, ");p = mystrcat(p,"George, ");p = mystrcat(p,"Joel ");
How much should we allocate? Let's try doing this The Right Way.
char* bigString;int i = 0;i = strlen("John, ") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + strlen("Paul, ") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + strlen("George, ") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + strlen("Joel ");bigString = (char*) malloc (i + 1); /* remember space for null terminator! */...
My eyes glazeth over. You're probably about ready to change the channel already. I don't blame you, but bear with me because it gets really interesting.
We have to scan through all the strings once just figuring out how big they are, then we scan through them again concatenating. At least if you use Pascal strings the strlen operation is fast. Maybe we can write a version of strcat that reallocates memory for us. 
That opens another whole can of worms: memory allocators. Do you know how malloc works? The nature of malloc is that it has a long linked list of available blocks of memory called the free chain. When you call malloc, it walks the linked list looking for a block of memory that is big enough for your request. Then it cuts that block into two blocks -- one the size you asked for, the other with the extra bytes, and gives you the block you asked for, and puts the leftover block (if any) back into the linked list. When you call free, it adds the block you freed onto the free chain. Eventually, the free chain gets chopped up into little pieces and you ask for a big piece and there are no big pieces available the size you want. So malloc calls a timeout and starts rummaging around the free chain, sorting things out, and merging adjacent small free blocks into larger blocks. This takes 3 1/2 days. The end result of all this mess is that the performance characteristic of malloc is that it's never very fast (it always walks the free chain), and sometimes, unpredictably, it's shockingly slow while it cleans up. (This is, incidentally, the same performance characteristic of garbage collected systems, surprise surprise, so all the claims people make about how garbage collection imposes a performance penalty are not entirely true, since typical malloc implementations had the same kind of performance penalty, albeit milder.)
Smart programmers minimize the potential distruption of malloc by always allocating blocks of memory that are powers of 2 in size. You know, 4 bytes,&nbsp;8 bytes, 16 bytes, 18446744073709551616 bytes, etc. For reasons that should be intuitive to anyone who plays with Lego, this minimizes the amount of weird fragmentation that goes on in the free chain. Although it may seem like this wastes space, it is also easy to see how it never wastes more than 50% of the space. So your program uses no more than twice as much memory as it needs to, which is not that big a deal.
Suppose you wrote a smart strcat function that reallocates the&nbsp;destination buffer automatically. Should it always reallocate it to the exact size&nbsp;needed? My teacher and mentor Stan Eisenstat&nbsp;suggests that when you call realloc, you should always double the size of memory that was&nbsp;previously allocated. That means that you never have to call realloc more than&nbsp;lg n&nbsp;times, which has decent performance characteristics even for huge strings, and you never waste more than 50% of your memory.
Anyway. Life just gets messier and messier down here in byte-land. Aren't you glad you don't have to write in C anymore? We have all these great languages like Perl and Java and VB and XSLT that never make you think of anything like this, they just deal with it, somehow. But occasionally, the plumbing infrastructure sticks up in the middle of the living room, and we have to think about whether to use a String class or a StringBuilder class, or some such distinction, because the compiler is still not smart enough to understand everything about what we're trying to accomplish and is trying to help us not write inadvertent Shlemiel the Painter algorithms.

Last week I wrote that you can't implement the SQL statement SELECT author FROM books fast when your data is stored in XML. Just in case everybody didn't understand what I was talking about, and&nbsp;now that we've been rolling around in the CPU all day, this assertion might make more sense.
How does a relational database implement SELECT author FROM books? In a relational database, every row in a table (e.g. the books table) is exactly the same length in bytes, and every fields is always at a fixed offset from the beginning of the row. So, for example, if each record in the books table is 100 bytes long, and the author field is at offset 23, then there are authors stored at byte 23, 123, 223, 323, etc. What is the code to move to the next record in the result of this query? Basically, it's this:
pointer += 100;
One CPU instruction. Faaaaaaaaaast.
Now lets look at the books table in XML.
&lt;?xml blah blah&gt;&lt;books&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;book&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;UI Design for Programmers&lt;/title&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;author&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/author&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/book&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;book&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;The Chop Suey Club&lt;/title&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;author&gt;Bruce Weber&lt;/author&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/book&gt;&lt;/books&gt;
Quick question. What is the code to move to the next record?
Uh...
At this point a good programmer would say, well, let's parse the XML into a tree in memory so that we can operate on it reasonably quickly. The amount of work that has to be done here by the CPU to SELECT author FROM books will bore you absolutely to tears. As every compiler writer knows, lexing and parsing are the slowest part of compiling. Suffice it to say that it involves a lot of string stuff, which we discovered is slow, and a lot of memory allocation stuff, which we discovered is slow, as we lex, parse, and build an abstract syntax tree in memory. That assumes that you have enough memory to load the whole thing at once. With relational databases, the performance of moving from record to record is fixed and is, in&nbsp;fact, one CPU instruction.&nbsp;That's very much by design. And&nbsp;thanks to memory mapped files you only have to load the pages of&nbsp;disk that you are actually going to use.&nbsp;With XML, if you preparse, the performance of moving from record to record is fixed but there's a huge startup time, and if you don't preparse, the performance of moving from record to record varies based on the length of the record before it and is still hundreds of CPU instructions long.
What this means to me is that you can't use XML if you need performance and have lots of data. If you have a little bit of data, or if what you're doing doesn't have to be fast, XML is a fine format. And if you really want the best of both worlds, you have to come up with a way to store metadata next to your XML, something like Pascal strings' byte count, which give you hints about where things are in the file so that you don't have to parse and scan for them. But of course then you can't use text editors to edit the file because that messes up the metadata, so it's not really XML anymore.
For those three gracious members of my audience who are still with me at this point, I hope you've learned something or rethought something. I hope that thinking about boring first-year computer-science stuff like how strcat and malloc actually work has given you new tools to think about the latest, top level, strategic and architectural decisions that you make in dealing with technologies like XML. For homework, think about why Transmeta chips will always feel sluggish. Or why the original HTML spec for TABLES was so badly designed that large tables on web pages can't be shown quickly to people with modems. Or about why COM is so dang fast but not when you're crossing process boundaries. Or about why the NT guys put the display driver into kernelspace instead of userspace.
These are all things that require you to think about bytes, and they affect the big top-level decisions we make in all kinds of architecture and strategy. This is why my view of teaching is that first year CS students need to start at the basics, using C&nbsp;and building their way up from the CPU. I am actually physically disgusted that so many computer science programs think that Java is a good introductory language, because it's "easy" and you don't get confused with all that boring string/malloc stuff but you can learn cool OOP stuff which will make your big programs ever so modular. This is a pedagogical disaster waiting to happen. Generations of graduates are descending on us and creating Shlemiel The Painter algorithms right and left and they don't even realize it, since they fundamentally have no idea that strings are, at a very deep level, difficult, even if you can't quite see that in your perl script. If you want to teach somebody something well, you have to start at the very lowest level. It's like Karate Kid. Wax On, Wax Off. Wax On, Wax Off. Do that for three weeks. Then Knocking The Other Kid's Head off is easy.

Jamie Zawinski is what I would call a duct-tape programmer. And I say that with a great deal of respect. He is the kind of programmer who is hard at work building the future, and making useful things so that people can do stuff. He is the guy you want on your team building go-carts, because he has two favorite tools: duct tape and WD-40. And he will wield them elegantly even as your go-cart is careening down the hill at a mile a minute. This will happen while other programmers are still at the starting line arguing over whether to use titanium or some kind of space-age composite material that Boeing is using in the 787 Dreamliner.
When you are done, you might have a messy go-cart, but it’ll sure as hell fly.
I just read an interview with Jamie in the book Coders at Work, by Peter Seibel. Go buy it now. It’s a terrific set of interviews with some great programmers, including Peter Norvig, Guy Steele, and Donald Knuth. This book is so interesting I did 60 minutes on the treadmill yesterday instead of the usual 30 because I couldn’t stop reading. Like I said, go buy it.
Go! I’ll wait. 
Here is why I like duct tape programmers. Sometimes, you’re on a team, and you’re busy banging out the code, and somebody comes up to your desk, coffee mug in hand, and starts rattling on about how if you use multi-threaded COM apartments, your app will be 34% sparklier, and it’s not even that hard, because he’s written a bunch of templates, and all you have to do is multiply-inherit from 17 of his templates, each taking an average of 4 arguments, and you barely even have to write the body of the function. It’s just a gigantic list of multiple-inheritance from different classes and hey, presto, multi-apartment threaded COM. And your eyes are swimming, and you have no friggin’ idea what this frigtard is talking about, but he just won’t go away, and even if he does go away, he’s just going back into his office to write more of his clever classes constructed entirely from multiple inheritance from templates, without a single implementation body at all, and it’s going to crash like crazy and you’re going to get paged at night to come in and try to figure it out because he’ll be at some goddamn “Design Patterns” meetup.
And the duct-tape programmer is not afraid to say, “multiple inheritance sucks. Stop it. Just stop.” 
You see, everybody else is too afraid of looking stupid because they just can’t keep enough facts in their head at once to make multiple inheritance, or templates, or COM, or multithreading, or any of that stuff work. So they sheepishly go along with whatever faddish programming craziness has come down from the architecture astronauts who speak at conferences and write books and articles and are so much smarter than us that they don’t realize that the stuff that they’re promoting is too hard for us.
Here’s what Zawinski says about Netscape: “It was decisions like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time.”
Later, he wrote an email client at Netscape, but the team that was responsible for actually displaying the message never shipped their component. “There was just this big blank rectangle in the middle of the window where we could only display plain text. They were being extremely academic about their project. They were trying to approach it from the DOM/DTD side of things. ‘Oh, well, what we need to do is add another abstraction layer here, and have a delegate for this delegate for this delegate. And eventually a character will show up on the screen.’”
Peter asked Zawinski, “Overengineering seems to be a pet peeve of yours.”
“Yeah,” he says, “At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It’s great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it’ll actually be pretty. But that’s not the point—you’re not here to write code; you’re here to ship products.”
My hero.
Zawinski didn’t do many unit tests. They “sound great in principle. Given a leisurely development pace, that’s certainly the way to go. But when you’re looking at, ‘We’ve got to go from zero to done in six weeks,’ well, I can’t do that unless I cut something out. And what I’m going to cut out is the stuff that’s not absolutely critical. And unit tests are not critical. If there’s no unit test the customer isn’t going to complain about that.”
Remember, before you freak out, that Zawinski was at Netscape when they were changing the world. They thought that they only had a few months before someone else came along and ate their lunch. A lot of important code is like that.
Duct tape programmers are pragmatic. Zawinski popularized Richard Gabriel’s precept of Worse is Better. A 50%-good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has because it’s in your lab where you’re endlessly polishing the damn thing. Shipping is a feature. A really important feature. Your product must have it.
One principle duct tape programmers understand well is that any kind of coding technique that’s even slightly complicated is going to doom your project. Duct tape programmers tend to avoid C++, templates, multiple inheritance, multithreading, COM, CORBA, and a host of other technologies that are all totally reasonable, when you think long and hard about them, but are, honestly, just a little bit too hard for the human brain. 
Sure, there’s nothing officially wrong with trying to write multithreaded code in C++ on Windows using COM. But it’s prone to disastrous bugs, the kind of bugs that only happen under very specific timing scenarios, because our brains are not, honestly, good enough to write this kind of code. Mediocre programmers are, frankly, defensive about this, and they don’t want to admit that they’re not able to write this super-complicated code, so they let the bullies on their team plow away with some godforsaken template architecture in C++ because otherwise they’d have to admit that they just don’t feel smart enough to use what would otherwise be a perfectly good programming technique FOR SPOCK. Duct tape programmers don’t give a shit what you think about them. They stick to simple basic and easy to use tools and use the extra brainpower that these tools leave them to write more useful features for their customers.
One thing you have to be careful about, though, is that duct tape programmers are the software world equivalent of pretty boys... those breathtakingly good-looking young men who can roll out of bed, without shaving, without combing their hair, and without brushing their teeth, and get on the subway in yesterday’s dirty clothes and look beautiful, because that’s who they are. You, my friend, cannot go out in public without combing your hair. It will frighten the children. Because you’re just not that pretty. Duct tape programmers have to have a lot of talent to pull off this shtick. They have to be good enough programmers to ship code, and we’ll forgive them if they never write a unit test, or if they xor the “next” and “prev” pointers of their linked list into a single DWORD to save 32 bits, because they’re pretty enough, and smart enough, to pull it off.
Did you buy Coders at Work&nbsp;yet? Go! This was just the first chapter!

	                Sitges and Day Trips from Barcelona
	                Blog: Barcelona Travel and Living - 5 October 2009
	                There is so much to do and see in Barcelona that the idea of taking a day trip from Barcelona seems a crazy idea. Why visit outside of Barcelona when there is just so much to do and see in the city itself, including all of Gaudi's attractions, the beach and the shopping. Many people though love to get out of the big city for a day and their are in fact some good options.

		      Compact Barcelona is a bright, fiery star lapped by the Mediterranean, a magnet to everyone from art-loving beach bums to business execs with a weakness for sunny downtime. It’s a city in motion, constantly reinventing itself. Here, past merges with future in an effervescent present. You can see it in the city's beautifully preserved Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter), in the architectural confections of Gaudí and his Modernista pals, and in recent contender Jean Nouvel's shimmering Torre Agbar.

 The heady mix of Gothic monuments and contemporary skyscrapers is accompanied by a bevy of world-class museums that take you from the wonders of giant Romanesque frescoes to the playfulness of Joan Miró, from pre-Columbian South American gold to early Picasso.
	                
All that culture fuels the appetite and at times the entire city seems to be out to lunch (or dinner). Thousands of restaurants offer an incredible palette for the palate: traditional Catalan cooking, 21st-century nueva cocina española kookiness and everything in between. A plethora of tippling establishments and dance clubs also spreads in a hedonistic arc across the entire city. Drop into old-school coctelerías or glam it up in bright new seaside bars. Shoppers, meanwhile, may never make it to a museum. Phalanxes of groovy one-off establishments compete with armies of global-brand-name stores.
	                
Culture, cuisine and conspicuous consumption aside, Barcelona is a city built for outdoor fun: just follow the locals' lead. On the waterfront, rollerbladers glide past domino-playing pensioners, sun-seekers, windsurfers and sailors. Skateboarders practise their art in motion outside the Macba, temple to contemporary creation, and mountain-bikers blaze trails in the Collserola park.
	                
Barcelona is an intoxicating ride. Once is unlikely to be enough.

				The Northern Neck, the northern-most of Virginia's three peninsulas on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay, was the birthplace of George Washington. 
But to some, this lush and laid-back region 2 1/2 hours from Washington, D.C., has an equally important claim to fame: It boasts a winemaking history dating back 400 years and is currently home to some of the county's hottest wine producers. 
What better time to visit the Chesapeake Bay Wine Trail than October - the 21st Virginia Wine Month, with many events planned? 
Award-winning, artisanal products are showcased by nine Northern Neck boutique wineries, each with a background nearly as tantalizing as the wine. 
You can spend a delightful weekend moseying your way along the trail - all the wineries offer picnic facilities and free tours. Essential sipping stops include: 
Athena Vineyards &amp; Winery, Heathsville (804-580-4944; www.athenavineyards.com)
The three owners - women in their 60s, longtime friends and former nurses - started Athena in 2002 as a retirement project. Their first vine planting was torpedoed by Hurricane Isabel in 2003. They soldiered on, and today Athena, named for the Greek goddess of wisdom, grows 20 varieties of grapes on 14 rolling acres. Indulge in the Jacques Recht Pinot Noir with tones of blackberry and blueberry. Tastings are $3. 
Ingleside Vineyards, Oak Grove (804-224-8687; www.inglesidevineyards.com)
This local favorite, nestled on a 3,000-acre plantation, began as a boys' school, Washington Academy, in 1834 - morphing into a Civil War garrison, courthouse and dairy farm before settling into its current incarnation in 1980. 
Ingleside's handcrafted wines consistently win top honors in state, national and international wine competitions. The Blue Crab Blanc, light and fruity in a festive blue bottle, is a surefire crowd-pleaser. Ingleside's $3 tastings include a souvenir wine glass. 
White Fences Vineyard &amp; Winery, Irvington (804-438-5559; www.whitefencesvineyard.com)
It's hard to miss the two 25-foot-tall corkscrew sculptures "guarding"the vineyard's entrance, built by the feisty owner to get around the town ordinance forbidding large signs (the corkscrews are considered monuments). 
The premier wine label here is Meteor, named for the spectral visions that occasionally light up the near-total blackness of the country sky. The slightly oaky, crisp Meteor Glow, a Chardonnelle, will light up your palate. Tastings are $4. 
IF YOU GO ...
Check www.farecompare.com for cheap flights from New York to Richmond, an hour from the Northern Neck. The "Passport Program" on ChesapeakeBayWineTrail.com lists discounts and prizes available until Dec. 20, including free stays at member bed-and-breakfasts. 
The Tides Inn (1-800-843-3746; www.tidesinn.com), the only Virginia resort included in Travel &amp; Leisure's latest Top 100, offers great savings via its Women Wild About Wine weekend packages. 
When you've sipped to satiation, check out the region's myriad other charms, including the George Washington Birthplace National Monument (www.nps.gov/gewa), nature and birding trails, great and affordable dining - and an atmosphere that still resonates with the grace and quietude of Revolutionary times. 
For more information on the region, go to www.VirginiaWine.org or www.NorthernNeck.org.

Welcome to Perl.
Perl is the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages:  powerful and
adaptable.  It was first developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working
as a systems administrator for NASA in the late 1980s, as a way to make
report processing easier.  Since then, it has moved into a large number of
roles: automating system administration, acting as glue between different
computer systems; and, of course, being one of the most popular languages
for CGI programming on the Web.
Why did Perl become so popular when the Web came along?  Two reasons:
First, most of what is being done on the Web happens with text, and is
best done with a language that's designed for text processing.  More
importantly, Perl was appreciably better than the alternatives at the
time when people needed something to use.  C is complex and can
produce security problems (especially with untrusted data), Tcl can be awkward and Python didn't really
have a foothold.
It also didn't hurt that Perl is a friendly language.  It plays
well with your personal programming style.  The Perl slogan is
``There's more than one way to do it,'' and that lends itself well to
large and small problems alike.
In this first part of our series, you'll learn a few basics about Perl
and see a small sample program.

A Word About Operating Systems
In this series, I'm going to assume that you're using a Unix system and
that your Perl interpreter is located at /usr/local/bin/perl.  It's OK
if you're running Windows; most Perl code is platform-independent.

Your First Perl Program
Take the following text and put it into a file called first.pl:

     #!/usr/local/bin/perl
     print &quot;Hi there!\n&quot;;
(Traditionally, first programs are supposed to say Hello world!,
but I'm an iconoclast.)
Now, run it with your Perl interpreter.  From a command line, go to the
directory with this file and type perl first.pl.  You should see:

     Hi there!
The \n indicates the ``newline'' character; without it, Perl doesn't
skip to a new line of text on its own.

Functions and Statements
Perl has a rich library of functions.  They're the verbs of Perl,
the commands that the interpreter runs.  You can see a list of all the
built-in functions on the perlfunc main page.  Almost all functions can
be given a list of parameters, which are separated by commas.
The print function is one of the most frequently used parts of
Perl.  You use it to display things on the screen or to send
information to a file (which we'll discuss in the next article).  It
takes a list of things to output as its parameters.

   print &quot;This is a single statement.&quot;;
   print &quot;Look, &quot;, &quot;a &quot;, &quot;list!&quot;;
A Perl program consists of statements, each of which ends with a
semicolon.  Statements don't need to be on separate lines; there may
be multiple statements on one line or a single statement can be split
across multiple lines.

    print &quot;This is &quot;; print &quot;two statements.\n&quot;; print &quot;But this &quot;,
          &quot;is only one statement.\n&quot;;

Numbers, Strings and Quotes
There are two basic data types in Perl: numbers and strings.
Numbers are easy; we've all dealt with them.  The only thing you need
to know is that you never insert commas or spaces into numbers in Perl.
always write 10000, not 10,000 or 10 000.
Strings are a bit more complex.  A string is a collection of characters
in either single or double quotes:

   'This is a test.'
   &quot;Hi there!\n&quot;
The difference between single quotes and double quotes is that single
quotes mean that their contents should be taken literally, while double
quotes mean that their contents should be interpreted.  For example,
the character sequence \n is a newline character when it appears in a
string with double quotes, but is literally the two characters, backslash
and n, when it appears in single quotes.

    print &quot;This string\nshows up on two lines.&quot;;
    print 'This string \n shows up on only one.';
(Two other useful backslash sequences are \t to insert a tab character,
and \\ to insert a backslash into a double-quoted string.)

Variables
If functions are Perl's verbs, then variables are its nouns.  Perl has
three types of variables: scalars, arrays and hashes.  Think of
them as ``things,'' ``lists,'' and ``dictionaries.''    In Perl, all variable
names are a punctuation character, a letter or underscore, and one or more
alphanumeric characters or underscores.
Scalars are single things.  This might be a number or a string.
The name of a scalar begins with a dollar sign, such as $i or
$abacus.  You assign a value to a scalar by telling Perl what it
equals, like so:

    $i = 5;
    $pie_flavor = 'apple';
    $constitution1776 = &quot;We the People, etc.&quot;;
You don't need to specify whether a scalar is a number or a string.
It doesn't matter, because when Perl needs to treat a scalar as a string,
it does; when it needs to treat it as a number, it does.  The conversion
happens automatically.  (This is different from many other languages,
where strings and numbers are two separate data types.)
If you use a double-quoted string, Perl will insert the value of any
scalar variables you name in the string.  This is often used to fill in
strings on the fly:

    $apple_count = 5; 
    $count_report = &quot;There are $apple_count apples.&quot;;
    print &quot;The report is: $count_report\n&quot;;
The final output from this code is The report is: There are 5 apples..
Numbers in Perl can be manipulated with the usual mathematical
operations: addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
(Multiplication and division are indicated in Perl with the * and
/ symbols, by the way.)

    $a = 5;
    $b = $a + 10;       # $b is now equal to 15.
    $c = $b * 10;       # $c is now equal to 150.
    $a = $a - 1;        # $a is now 4, and algebra teachers are cringing.
You can also use special operators like ++, --, +=, -=, /= and *=.
These manipulate a scalar's value without needing two elements in an
equation.  Some people like them, some don't.  I like the fact that they
can make code clearer.

   $a = 5;
   $a++;        # $a is now 6; we added 1 to it.
   $a += 10;    # Now it's 16; we added 10.
   $a /= 2;     # And divided it by 2, so it's 8.
Strings in Perl don't have quite as much flexibility.  About the only
basic operator that you can use on strings is concatenation, which is
a $10 way of saying ``put together.''  The concatenation operator
is the period.  Concatenation and addition are two different things:

   $a = &quot;8&quot;;    # Note the quotes.  $a is a string.
   $b = $a + &quot;1&quot;;   # &quot;1&quot; is a string too.
   $c = $a . &quot;1&quot;;   # But $b and $c have different values!
Remember that Perl converts strings to numbers transparently whenever
it's needed, so to get the value of $b, the Perl interpreter converted
the two strings &quot;8&quot; and &quot;1&quot; to numbers, then added them.  The value of
$b is the number 9.  However, $c used concatenation, so its value is
the string &quot;81&quot;.
Just remember, the plus sign adds numbers and the period puts
strings together.
Arrays are lists of scalars.  Array names begin with @.  You define
arrays by listing their contents in parentheses, separated by commas:

    @lotto_numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);  # Hey, it could happen.
    @months = (&quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;);
The contents of an array are indexed beginning with 0.  (Why not 1?
Because.  It's a computer thing.)  To retrieve the elements of an array,
you replace the @ sign with a $ sign, and follow that with the
index position of the element you want.  (It begins with a dollar sign
because you're getting a scalar value.)  You can also modify it in place,
just like any other scalar.

    @months = (&quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;);
    print $months[0];   # This prints &quot;July&quot;.
    $months[2] = &quot;Smarch&quot;;  # We just renamed September!
If an array doesn't exist, by the way, you'll create it when you try to
assign a value to one of its elements.

    $winter_months[0] = &quot;December&quot;;  # This implicitly creates @winter_months.
Arrays always return their contents in the same order; if you go
through @months from beginning to end, no matter how many times
you do it, you'll get back July, August and September in that order.
If you want to find the length
of an array, use the value $#array_name.  This is one less than
the number of elements in the array.  If the array just doesn't exist
or is empty, $#array_name is -1.  If you want to resize an array,
just change the value of $#array_name.

    @months = (&quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;);
    print $#months;         # This prints 2.
    $a1 = $#autumn_months;  # We don't have an @autumn_months, so this is -1.
    $#months = 0;           # Now @months only contains &quot;July&quot;.
Hashes are called ``dictionaries'' in some programming languages,
and that's what they are: a term and a definition, or in more correct
language a key and a value.  Each key in a hash has one and only one
corresponding value.  The name of a hash begins with a percentage sign, like %parents.  You define hashes by comma-separated pairs of
key and value, like so:

    %days_in_month = ( &quot;July&quot; =&gt; 31, &quot;August&quot; =&gt; 31, &quot;September&quot; =&gt; 30 );
You can fetch any value from a hash by referring to $hashname{key},
or modify it in place just like any other scalar.

    print $days_in_month{&quot;September&quot;}; # 30, of course.
    $days_in_month{&quot;February&quot;} = 29;   # It's a leap year.
If you want to see what keys are in a hash, you can use the keys
function with the name of the hash.  This returns a list containing
all of the keys in the hash.  The list isn't always in the same order,
though; while we could count on @months to always return
July, August, September in that order,
keys %days_in_summer might
return them in any order whatsoever.

    @month_list = keys %days_in_summer;
    # @month_list is now ('July', 'September', 'August') !
The three types of variables have three separate namespaces.  That
means that $abacus and @abacus are two different variables, and
$abacus[0] (the first element of @abacus) is not the same as
$abacus{0} (the value in abacus that has the key 0).

Comments
Notice that in some of the code samples from the previous section, I've
used code comments.  These are useful for explaining what a particular
piece of code does, and vital for any piece of code you plan to modify, enhance, fix, or just look at again.  (That is to say, comments
are vital for all code.)
Anything in a line of Perl code that follows a # sign is a comment.
(Except, of course, if the # sign appears in a string.)

   print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;  # That's more like it.
   # This entire line is a comment.

Loops
Almost every time you write a program, you'll need to use a loop.
Loops allow you run a particular piece of code over and over again.
This is part of a general concept in programming called flow control.
Perl has several different functions that are useful for flow control,
the most basic of which is for.  When you use the for function,
you specify a variable that will be used for the loop index, and a
list of values to loop over.  Inside a pair of curly brackets, you put
any code you want to run during the loop:

     for $i (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) {
         print &quot;$i\n&quot;;
     }
This loop prints the numbers 1 through 5, each on a separate line.
A handy shortcut for defining loops is using .. to specify a range
of numbers.  You can write (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as (1 .. 5).  You can also use
arrays and scalars in your loop list.  Try this code and see what happens:

    @one_to_ten = (1 .. 10);
    $top_limit = 25;
    for $i (@one_to_ten, 15, 20 .. $top_limit) {
        print &quot;$i\n&quot;;
    }
The items in your loop list don't have to be numbers; you can use strings
just as easily.  If the hash %month_has contains names of months and
the number of days in each month, you can use the keys function to step
through them.

    for $i (keys %month_has) {
        print &quot;$i has $month_has{$i} days.\n&quot;;
    }

    for $marx ('Groucho', 'Harpo', 'Zeppo', 'Karl') {

        print &quot;$marx is my favorite Marx brother.\n&quot;;
    }

The Miracle of Compound Interest
You now know enough about Perl - variables, print, and for() - to write a small, useful program.  Everyone loves money, so the first sample
program is a compound-interest calculator.  It will print a (somewhat)
nicely formatted table showing the value of an investment over a number
of years.  (You can see the program at compound_interest.pl)
The single most complex line in the program is this one:

    $interest = int (($apr / 100) * $nest_egg * 100) / 100;
$apr / 100 is the interest rate, and ($apr / 100) * $nest_egg is
the amount of interest earned in one year.  This line uses the
int() function, which returns the integer value of a scalar (its
value after any fractional part has been stripped off).  We use
int() here because when you multiply, for example, 10925 by
9.25%, the result is 1010.5625, which  we must round off to
1010.56.  To do this, we multiply by 100, yielding 101056.25, use
int() to throw away the leftover fraction, yielding 101056, and
then divide by 100 again, so that the final result is 1010.56.  Try
stepping through this statement yourself to see just how we end up
with the correct result, rounded to cents.

Play Around!
At this point you have some basic knowledge of Perl syntax and a few
simple toys to play with - print, for(), keys(), and int().
Try writing some simple programs with them.  Here are two suggestions,
one simple and the other a little more complex:

       A word frequency counter.  How often does each word show up in
       an array of words?  Print out a report. (Hint: Use a hash to
       count of the number of appearances of each word.)

       Given a month and the day of the week that's the first of that
       month, print a calendar for the month.  (Remember, you need \n
       to go to a new line.)

Learn That Name, a new iPhone app designed to help people remember the names of people they bump into at events, won the most votes at Startup Weekend even though the 54-hour coding marathon was held on Microsoft's campus. Attorney Eric Koester -- who came up with the idea because he forgot the name of one of the attendees -- said he's hopeful to have the $2.99 app approved in the Apple store in the coming weeks. Here's the&nbsp;10-minute pitch.




Interestingly, 14 of the 15 teams at the event built their products on the Microsoft platform -- driven in part by the prize money offered by the BizSpark program.
But at the end of the day, it was a mobile app on a competing platform that won the most votes in Microsoft's backyard.
&quot;Awkward,&quot;&nbsp;whispered Startup Weekend organizer Clint Nelsen into the microphone upon announcing the top voter getter.
&quot;It's been an awesome experience,&quot; said Koester, who led the team of more than a dozen developers. &quot;I was just looking for something simple and this was really way more than I anticipated in 48 hours.&quot;
In a post event&nbsp;team meeting, Koester slapped high fives with coders and laid out the plans for moving the business forward. &quot;Awesome guys, this was fun. We are going to do it again,&quot;&nbsp;he said.
Meanwhile, Search Kick&nbsp;received $5,000 for winning the most votes as a startup building its application on Microsoft technologies, as well as the potential for a $5,000 investment from the Seattle technology incubator H-Farm.
More than 190 people attended the event, including&nbsp;developers from as far away as Chicago, Paris and LA.
Startup Weekend's Nelsen said they're hoping to have the next event at Amazon.com. Last year's event was held at Google's Fremont campus.
