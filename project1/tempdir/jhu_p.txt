  Productivity for developers, performance for users
  
  Writing web apps today is a tedious and error-prone process. Developers can spend 90% of their time working around browser quirks. In addition, building, reusing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases and AJAX components can be difficult and fragile. 
  Google Web Toolkit (GWT), especially when combined with the Google Plugin for Eclipse, eases this burden by allowing developers to quickly build and maintain complex yet highly performant JavaScript front-end applications in the Java programming language.

        What is it?
        
          Git is a
          fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for
          the collaborative development of software.
        
        

          GitHub is the easiest (and prettiest) way to participate
          in that collaboration: fork projects, send pull requests, monitor development,
          all with ease.
        
      


      
        How does it work?
        
          Get up and running in seconds by forking a project, pushing an existing repository, or starting fresh. No approval is necessary.
        
        
          GitHub was written for public, open source projects and private, proprietary codes &mdash; if you use Git, GitHub is for you.
        

        What else does it do?
        
          GitHub provides pre-rolled post-commit hooks (IRC, Jabber, Email, Trac, Campfire, etc.) as well as an innovative web hook system for writing your own.
        

        
          Every repository comes with SSH support for pushing and pulling.  Private repositories enjoy full SSL support on the web side, as well.
        
      

    
  

  
    Finally a code repository that works as well as you do.

Learn all about Groovy, Grails and Griffon at the 2GX Conference



2GX Conference is the largest North American Groovy and Grails conference series. 

This year's event will take place October 19 - 22, 2009 in New Orleans, LA (USA). You will learn about rapid application development with Groovy / Grails and network with other developers who are redefining the way web applications are developed on the Java platform.

The conference is dedicated to Groovy, Grails and Griffon, is co-hosted alongside the SpringOne conference. Experts and makers of these Groovy-based technologies will guide attendees through lectures around those technologies.

Experience the latest Groovy 1.6

 Groovy 1.6, the latest major and stable version of the popular dynamic language for the JVM, has been released. In a nutshell, it brings great compile-time and runtime performance improvements, multiple assignments, optional return in if/else and try/catch blocks, Compile-time Metaprogramming - AST Transformations and all the provided transformation annotations like @Singleton, @Lazy, @Immutable, @Delegate and friends, the Grapes and grab() and its @Grab annotation, various Swing builder and Swing console improvements, the integration of Groovy JmxBuilder, JSR-223 scripting engine built-in, and various metaprogramming improvements, like the ExpandoMetaClass DSL, per-instance metaclasses even for POJOS and runtime mixins.

Groovy, an award-winning creative and innovative project



&nbsp;JAX is the most important Java conference in Germany. Every year, the organizers are running a contest to select the most innovative and creative projects. From over 40 proposals, the jury selected only ten nominees. Although great projects were selected, like the Matisse GUI builder in NetBeans, or the Nuxeo Enterprise Content Management solution, Groovy won the first prize! It is a great honor and a huge pleasure for us to receive such a prize, especially knowing the cool projects we were competing with, or the past winners like the Spring framework.
Dierk K&ouml;nig, author of the best-selling "Groovy in Action" book, received the prize in the name of the Groovy community, after having presented several sessions on Groovy at this conference. This award proves and reaffirms how innovative, creative and influential the Groovy project is for the Java community.






"Groovy is like a super version of Java. It can leverage Java's enterprise capabilities but also has cool productivity features like closures, builders and dynamic typing. If you are a developer, tester or script guru, you have to love Groovy."











Samples

A simple hello world script:


def name='World'; println "Hello $name!"




A more sophisticated version using Object Orientation:



class Greet {
  def name
  Greet(who) { name = who[0].toUpperCase() +
                      who[1..-1] }
  def salute() { println "Hello $name!" }
}

g = new Greet('world')  // create object
g.salute()              // Output "Hello World!"




Leveraging existing Java libraries:



import static org.apache.commons.lang.WordUtils.*

class Greeter extends Greet {
  Greeter(who) { name = capitalize(who) }
}

new Greeter('world').salute()




On the command line:


groovy -e "println 'Hello ' + args[0]" World

            Groovy 1.7-beta-2 is there

                 We're pleased to announce the release of Groovy 1.7-beta-2! 
This is the last release before the Release Candidate cycle, towards our final 1.7 release.

Although we're not formally into the RC cycle, this release is already almost exclusively about bug fixing. However, there's one last new feature added into the mix: customizable boolean coercion.

To learn more about this feature, I've added a new paragraph in the
release notes, in the section about "Groovy Truth" customizations.

You can download Groovy 1.7-beta-2 or view the JIRA release notes.

Thanks a lot to all involved!

            Windows-Installer for Groovy 1.6.5 released

            
                            Last changed Oct 04, 2009 11:16 by Joachim Baumann
                                            
                
                 The Windows-Installer for Groovy 1.6.5 can now be downloaded from the Groovy Website (direct link). It takes care of the gory details of a Windows installation, copying files, setting environment variables and file associations. This version of the installer checks whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit installation, and the native launcher executables are only installed for the 32-bit version (until we have 64-bit versions of the nativelauncher).

The installer contains the Groovy 1.6.5 Binaries, API Docs and a PDF snapshot of the Wiki, the native launcher, Gant 1.8.0, Scriptom 1.6.0, and the Griffon Builders. These contain, among others, GFXBuilder, SwingXBuilder and JideBuilder in versions compatible to Griffon 0.1.2. The installation of everything but the binaries including the native launcher is optional.

Currently supported languages for the installer are english, german, spanish, french and brazilian portuguese.

My Conversation with Austan Goolsbee at Web 2.0 Summit

He introduces himself as "another tall, skinny guy with big ears and a funny name." Economics adviser to Barack Obama during the campaign, and now a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, Austan Goolsbee is a key figure in framing the economic thinking of the Obama administration.  Perhaps most importantly for those of us in Silicon Valley, he's an economist clued in to the tech world.  I'll be interviewing Austan Goolsbee on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit.

Could Adobe potentially harm the iPhone AppStore

Adobe have spent a lot of cycles / years nudging Apple that Flash should be on the iPhone. Apple have firmly just said no, and despite the answer, Adobe keep expecting them to cave due to public demand. The problem with this logic is that Apple won't give in. Let's break this down into two parts: First, Don't poke the sleeping giant. Secondly, just because it's easy, doesn't mean its successful. Read more.

    
    



    
Vendor Relationship Management workshop

Nobody knows you as well as you do. Or do they? Let's run a test. Do you
know what percentage of your food bill went to processed products? Or
what type of coupons (store coupons, newspaper coupons, etc.) is most
likely to get you to switch brands? I bet someone out there knows.This kind of data mining is the modern companion to Customer Relations Management, which is the science of understanding customers and trying to get repeat business. CRM can offer many valuable benefits, but ultimately the control lies
with the vendor. A Vendor Relationship Management workshop at
Harvard looked at what it would take to leave control with the
customers. Read more.

    
    



    
The indexed XML website as a commodity
Syndication gone mad?
&nbsp;

Reviewing a few long-term, continuing multi-publishing projects I have been involved in recently, I am struck that several are morphing in a particular direction. The projects might have started as publishing paper or webpages, and moved to publishing high-level XML, but increasingly the commodity that needs to be packaged and distributed (for re-skinning and re-use by third parties) is the whole indexed dataset: in effect the website (without the implication of HTML pages.)  The client-person doesn't GET a webpage, they get a whole website (this is for B2B not B2C.) Read more.

Open Access Week -- October 19-23 is Open Access Week 2009.  Open Access Week marks a time to show support for "free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research."  Organizers hope that the week of higher visibility for their movement will encourage more people to support freely accessible research data with immediate online availability as soon as such research is published.  This and more in today's Four Short Links.

"He not busy being born is busy dying"

I found myself quoting that great Bob Dylan line the other day on a mailing list for those dealing with the changes sweeping through the publishing industry. Michael Coffey from Publisher's Weekly wrote an eloquent and moving lament that expresses the fear of many that the book might be losing its pre-eminent position in the cultural canon.

Mechanical Turk service provider CrowdFlower and microwork non-profit Samasource have teamed up to make their services available to iPhone users. Users of CrowdFlower's mechanical turk platform can now opt to send their tasks to iPhone users. The Give Work iPhone app takes tasks (created by real companies) and sends it to iPhone users who volunteer to complete them. Meanwhile, workers in a Kenyan refugee camp perform the same tasks using CrowdFlower's regular web interface. In essence, Kenyan refugees work to increase the accuracy of the results provided by the army of volunteer iPhone mechanical turks.  Read more.

During last year's Summit I had the good fortune to interview Kevin Kelly (see Technology is the Seventh Kingdom of Life).   In the interview Kevin made the case that we have only scratched the surface on how to coordinate group activities on the web:  there must be hundreds of effective methods to run an auction, crowdsource products etc.  We have only scratched the surface so why stop at eBay and Threadless?

One of the big announcements at MAX this year was Flash on devices.   As the capabilities of devices change, so do the capabilities of the platforms we use to build our applications.   One of the latest trends is Multi-touch.   In this post, I'll try to shed some light on the upcoming multitouch capabilities in AIR 2.0 and Flash Player 10.1. Read more.

Overview
RSpec is the original Behaviour Driven Development framework for Ruby.
The RSpec Book
The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends is now in beta.
The RSpec Book will introduce you to RSpec, Cucumber, and a number of other tools that make up the Ruby BDD family. Replete with tutorials and practical examples, the RSpec Book will help you get your BDD on, taking you from executable requirements to working software that is clean, well tested, well documented, flexible and highly maintainable.

Get Started Now

$ gem install rspec





Start with a very simple example that expresses
some basic desired behaviour.


# bowling_spec.rb
require 'bowling'

describe Bowling do
  it &quot;should score 0 for gutter game&quot; do
    bowling = Bowling.new
    20.times { bowling.hit(0) }
    bowling.score.should == 0
  end
end


Run the example and watch it fail.

$ spec bowling_spec.rb 
./bowling_spec.rb:4:
  uninitialized constant Bowling




Now write
just enough code to make it pass.


# bowling.rb
class Bowling
  def hit(pins)
  end

  def score
    0
  end
end


Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.

$ spec bowling_spec.rb --format specdoc

Bowling
- should score 0 for gutter game

Finished in 0.007534 seconds

1 example, 0 failures




Take very small steps
Don&#8217;t rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another example and let it guide you to what you have to do next. And don&#8217;t forget to take time to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep your code clean at every step of the way.
Take the first step now!

    &#8220;Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.
    Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months
    to develop can be produced in a matter of days.&#8221;

    -Tim O'Reilly, Founder of O'Reilly Media Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used.
    And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my
    own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than

    a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.&#8221;
    -James Duncan Davidson, Creator of Tomcat and Ant  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;It is impossible not to notice Ruby on Rails.  It has had a huge effect both in
    and outside the Ruby community... Rails has become a standard to which even

    well-established tools are comparing themselves to.&#8221;
    -Martin Fowler, Author of Refactoring, PoEAA, XP Explained  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;What sets this framework apart from all of the others is the preference for
    convention over configuration making applications easier

    to develop and understand.&#8221;
    -Sam Ruby, ASF board of directors  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;Before Ruby on Rails, web programming required a lot of verbiage, steps and time.
    Now, web designers and software engineers can develop a website

    much faster and more simply, enabling them to be more productive
    and effective in their work.&#8221;
    -Bruce Perens, Open Source Luminary  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;After researching the market, Ruby on Rails stood out as the best choice.

    We have been very happy with that decision.  We will continue
    building on Rails and consider it a key business advantage.&#8221;
    -Evan Williams, Creator of Blogger and ODEO  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;Ruby on Rails is astounding. Using it is like watching a kung-fu movie,

    where a dozen bad-ass frameworks prepare to beat up the little newcomer
    only to be handed their asses in a variety of imaginative ways.&#8221;
    -Nathan Torkington, O'Reilly Program Chair for OSCON  Read more quotes
  

  
    &#8220;Rails is the killer app for Ruby.&#8221;

Published&nbsp;July 15, 2009|Some people have been noticing issues with forum uploads over the last fortnight. These have been resolved and things should now be back to normal. Apologies for any inconvenience.

Published&nbsp;June 26, 2009|One of the very first sections of ActionScript.org was the open source Movies Section, which was sorely in need of an update. While it might not look any different, the section has been revitalized and is now ready to accept those FLA's you've got sitting around. Imagine how much use they could be to someone like you, trying to do exactly the same thing in a month's time! Why not add them now?

Show an Alert before the closure of an AIR application


By Guillermo de la Iglesia

		Rating:

		




	Unrated

 





Here I will explain how to create an Alert window when we press the
exit/close button in an AIR application, so that we have to validate
this exiting avoiding that it closes up directly. This way we can
control that the user closes the application without having
accomplished a necessary operation, for example, without saving the
changes made in an application that edits documents.













Another Useful, Reusable AS3 Class, &quot;ButtonDisabler&quot;

In this tutorial, we will build a class together that will automate the task of giving any group of buttons some "button disabling" behavior. You will learn about how to make the class handle any type of button. You will learn about how to decide what tasks ought to be "built-in" to the class, and which tasks are best managed by outside code. You will also learn about interfaces and polymorphism (painlessly, I promise). What you will learn about AS3 classes and OOP is the important thing, but at the same time, I think the ButtonDisabler class is something you wlll find handy and useful in the future. And I hope you'll also realize that if you can make something like this, there are any number of other similar things that you can make as well. It just takes some imagination.

        The Most Intelligent Java IDE
        Looking for a good IDE? You've just found the best.
        
            
                What's in it for You
                IntelliJ IDEA lets you code without a hitch. It practices a non-intrusive, intuitive approach to help
                you write, debug, refactor, test and learn your code. Thanks to its deep understanding of languages and
                technologies, IntelliJ IDEA provides a second pair of hands for you when you need them. Playing the game
                by your rules without ever getting in your way &mdash; that's our idea of a productive
                and pleasant development.
            
        
            
                What's in it for Your Team
                IntelliJ IDEA creates a convenient environment where all team members can work together efficiently.
                Transparent integration with a wide range of version control systems allows team members to stay in sync
                with each other's changes, ensuring that all contributions are properly put together. IntelliJ IDEA can
                coexist with other popular IDEs such as Eclipse and project management tools such as Maven, so your team
                can use each tool where it's best applicable.
                To further improve the overall team productivity, IntelliJ IDEA cooperates with JetBrains TeamCity, a powerful continuous integration and build server.
            
        
        
            
                What's in it for Your Company
                IntelliJ IDEA enables your company to deliver complex software products meeting high quality standards
                and tight project schedules. The IDE constantly validates code quality and offers instant fixes for
                found problems at all levels &mdash; from individual statements to the overall architecture, by using advanced
                code inspections and dependency matrix analysis. Be it a coding pattern issue, potential performance
                problem, or contract violation, IntelliJ IDEA displays a warning and fixes the issue, helping you
                produce clean, top-notch code in less time than ever.

The Festival of the Cranes Nov 17-22, 2009
Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge

2009 is the 22nd year the City of Socorro, New Mexico and the Bosque del Apache NWR will celebrate the return of the cranes with this popular and acclaimed Festival. Registration for the November 17-22 Festival is underway, and if you're considering being a part of it, we strongly urge you to register NOW!
Over 100 lectures, workshops, tours, hikes and hands-on activities are planned, ranging from the popular Sandhill Crane Behavior to special photography tours to socializing with locals on the Plaza. 2009 promises to be a banner year for attendance so start making your plans now.
Members of the Audubon Council of New Mexico, the Central New Mexico Audubon Society, the American Birding Association and the Friends of the Bosque Board will be on hand at the observation decks around the Bosque tour loops to assist visitors with questions and to share their birding expertise and scopes.
More than 50 volunteers will be staffing the hospitality tent and the information table at the Macey Center to answer questions and sell event tickets. More than 30 other Bosque volunteers will be driving vans, fixing meals, emptying trash and taking care of all the tasks that make the Festival such an enjoyable event.

Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and
integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python
and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance
costs.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and has been ported to
the Java and .NET virtual machines.
Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its
OSI-approved open source license.
The Python Software Foundation holds the
intellectual property rights behind Python, underwrites the PyCon
conference, and funds other projects
in the Python community.

Introducing Scala
Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Read&nbsp;more

  A while ago Alex McGuire gave us an insight into Scala at EDFT, now Lee Momtahan goes public talking at the Commercial Users of Functional Programming meeting, CUFP 2009 in Edinburgh, about their experiences at &Eacute;lectricit&eacute; de France Trading (EDFT). He is a member of a group developing applications for energy derivatives trading and pricing. He explains the benefits EDFT has gained by replacing a significant part of their 300,000 lines of Java code with Scala, DSLs and their impressions of Scala.

  With Swarm, Ian Clarke demonstrates a novel approach to programming distributed systems using Scala's serializable delimited continuations. Ian, CEO of Uprizer Labs and developer of SenseArray, is possibly best known for designing and coordinating Freenet, a popular P2P distributed network storage application. He presented Swarm at the IEEE Ninth International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing in Seattle,USA that took place September 9-11. You can watch a video where he describes Swarm.

  We are releasing a further minor maintenance version of Scala&nbsp;2.7 in order to address one rare issue that could result in a &quot;malformed Scala signature&quot; message. No other fixes or changes are included; if you have never encountered the message above, you will not notice any difference by upgrading. The new stable release of the Scala distribution, Scala 2.7.6 final, is available as usual from our Download Page.

      OSGi Alliance Approves Compendium Version 4.2 - Spring Inside
    
  
  
  
      
      Submitted by Adam Fitzgerald on Fri, 2009-09-25 12:37    
  
       in News and Announcements

  
  
    Yesterday the OSGi Alliance approved and published the Core Specification Version 4.2 and Service Compendium Version 4.2 of the OSGi Service Platform Release 4. The newest core and compendium specifications are designed to make it easier for developers to implement and use OSGi technology. A key part of the release was introducing new compendium services aligned with the Spring programming model:

Blueprint Container service uses XML definitions in a bundle to create and wire application objects, and defines a dependency injection framework - specifically for OSGi bundles - that understands the unique dynamic nature of services; it provides an OSGi bundle programming model with minimal implementation dependencies and virtually no accidental complexity in the Java code;

There has never been a better time for developers familiar with Spring to try out OSGi. Get started by working with the examples in SpringSource dm Server and the Spring Dynamic Modules project that will provide the reference implementation for the spec. 
  

      
      
    
  
 


      
      Spring BlazeDS Integration 1.0.1 Released

Dear Spring Community, 


I'm pleased to announce that the 1.0.1 maintenance release of Spring BlazeDS Integration, the open source solution for building Spring-powered RIAs with Adobe Flex, is now available. 


Download | Reference Documentation | JavaDocs | Changelog 


Along with a number of minor bug fixes and enhancements, we have done some restructuring of the popular Spring BlazeDS Test Drive bundled sample application to make it even easier to get up and running in a variety of different environments, and to bring some of the configuration elements further in line with what you might see in the near future in a SpringSource Tool Suite project creation template for Spring BlazeDS Integration projects.  Also, we've enhanced the security example further to really show how having Spring Security so tightly integrated sets this solution apart from alternate approaches to securing Flex applications.





As always, I encourage anyone interested to get involved by trying out the release and giving us feedback in the community forum and Jira.  We've been getting some great feedback from people having success with Spring BlazeDS Integration in their projects, and we look forward to hearing more about your experiences.


Lastly, for anyone headed to Adobe MAX 2009, be sure and check out the session I'll be co-presenting with Mark Fisher on "Integrating Spring with BlazeDS and LiveCycle Data Services" on Wednesday, October 7th at 2PM.
