Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years






Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years
Peter Norvig







Why is everyone in such a rush?

Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java
in 7 Days alongside endless variations offering to teach Visual
Basic, Windows, the Internet, and so on in a few days or hours.  I did
the following power search at Amazon.com: 

     pubdate: after 1992 and title: days and
      (title: learn or title: teach yourself)

and got back 248 hits.  The first 78 were computer books (number 79
was Learn
Bengali in 30 days).  I replaced "days" with "hours"
and got remarkably similar results: 253 more books, with 77 computer
books followed by Teach
Yourself Grammar and Style in 24 Hours at number 78. Out of
the top 200 total, 96% were computer books.  

The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn
about computers, or that computers are somehow fabulously easier to
learn than anything else.  There are no books on how to learn
Beethoven, or Quantum Physics, or even Dog Grooming in a few days.
Felleisen et al.
give a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say
"Bad programming is easy. Idiots can learn it in 21 days,
even if they are dummies.

 Let's analyze what a title like Learn C++ in Three Days
could mean:


Learn: In 3 days you won't have time to write several
significant programs, and learn from your successes and failures with
them.  You won't have time to work with an experienced programmer and
understand what it is like to live in a C++ environment.  In short, you
won't have time to learn much.  So the book can only be talking about a
superficial familiarity, not a deep understanding. As Alexander Pope said,
a little learning is a dangerous thing.

C++: In 3 days you might be able to learn some of the syntax of
C++ (if you already know another language), but you couldn't
learn much about how to use the language.  In short, if you were, say, a
Basic programmer, you could learn to write programs in the style of
Basic using C++ syntax, but you couldn't learn what C++ is
actually good (and bad) for.  So what's the point?  Alan
Perlis once said: "A language that doesn't affect the way you
think about programming, is not worth knowing".  One possible point is
that you have to learn a tiny bit of C++ (or more likely, something
like JavaScript or Flash's Flex) because you need to interface with an
existing tool to accomplish a specific task. But then you're not
learning how to program; you're learning to accomplish that task.

in Three Days: Unfortunately, this is not enough, as the next
section shows.


Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years

Researchers (Bloom
(1985), Bryan &amp; Harter (1899), Hayes
(1989), Simmon &amp; Chase (1973)) have shown it
takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of
areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph
operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in
neuropsychology and topology.  The key is deliberative
practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself
with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it,
analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting
any mistakes.  Then repeat.  And repeat again.  There appear to be no
real shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical prodigy at age 4, took
13 more years before he began to produce world-class music.  In
another genre, the Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a
string of #1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964.
But they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since
1957, and while they had mass appeal early on, their first great
critical success, Sgt. Peppers, was released in 1967. 
Malcolm
Gladwell reports that a study of students at the Berlin Academy of
Music compared the top, middle, and bottom third of the class and
asked them how much they had practiced:

Everyone, from all three groups, started playing at roughly the same
time - around the age of five. In those first few years, everyone
practised roughly the same amount - about two or three hours a
week. But around the age of eight real differences started to
emerge. The students who would end up as the best in their class began
to practise more than everyone else: six hours a week by age nine,
eight by age 12, 16 a week by age 14, and up and up, until by the age
of 20 they were practising well over 30 hours a week. By the age of
20, the elite performers had all totalled 10,000 hours of practice
over the course of their lives. The merely good students had totalled,
by contrast, 8,000 hours, and the future music teachers just over
4,000 hours.


So it may be that 10,000 hours, not 10 years, is the magic number.
Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) thought it
took longer: "Excellence in any department can be
attained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at
a lesser price."  And Chaucer (1340-1400) complained "the lyf so short, the craft
so long to lerne." Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt "ars longa,
vita brevis", which is part of the longer quotation "Ars longa, vita
brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium
difficile", which in English renders as "Life is short, [the] craft
long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment
difficult."  Although in Latin, ars can mean either art or
craft, in the original Greek the word "techne" can only mean "skill", not "art".



Here's my recipe for programming success:


 Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.  Make sure
that it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in ten years.

 Talk to other programmers; read other programs.  This is more important
than any book or training course.

 Program.  The best kind of learning is learning
by doing.  To put it more technically, "the maximal level of
performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained
automatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of
performance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as
a result of deliberate efforts to improve." (p. 366)
and "the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an
appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual,
informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections
of errors." (p. 20-21)  The book 
Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday
Life is an interesting 
reference for this viewpoint.

 If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a
graduate school).  This will give you access to some jobs that require
credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field,
but if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get
similar experience on the job. In any case, book learning alone won't
be enough. "Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert
programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make
somebody an expert painter" says Eric Raymond, author of The New
Hacker's Dictionary. One of the best programmers I ever hired had
only a High School degree; he's produced a lot of great software, has his own news group, and made enough in stock options to buy his own nightclub.

 Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer
on some projects; be the worst on some others.  When you're the best,
you get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire
others with your vision.  When you're the worst, you learn what the
masters do, and you learn what they don't like to do (because they
make you do it for them).

 Work on projects after other programmers. Be involved in
understanding a program written by someone else. See what it takes to
understand and fix it when the original programmers are not
around. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for
those who will maintain it after you.

 Learn at least a half dozen programming languages.  Include one
language that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that
supports functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one
that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one
that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++
templates), one that supports coroutines (like Icon or Scheme), and
one that supports parallelism (like Sisal).  

 Remember that there is a "computer" in "computer science". Know
how long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a
word from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek to a new location on disk. (Answers here.) 

 Get involved in a language
standardization effort.  It could be the ANSI C++ committee, or it
could be deciding if your local coding style will have 2 or 4 space
indentation levels.  Either way, you learn about what other people
like in a language, how deeply they feel so, and perhaps even a little
about why they feel so.

 Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as
quickly as possible.


With all that in mind, its questionable how far you can get just by
book learning.  Before my first child was born, I read all the How
To books, and still felt like a clueless novice.  30 Months later,
when my second child was due, did I go back to the books for a
refresher? No.  Instead, I relied on my personal experience, which
turned out to be far more useful  and reassuring
to me than the thousands of pages written
by experts.

Fred Brooks, in his essay No Silver Bullet 
identified a three-part plan for finding great
software designers:


   Systematically identify top designers as early as possible. 
   Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.
   Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.


This assumes that some people already have the qualities necessary for
being a great designer; the job is to properly coax them along.  Alan
Perlis put it more succinctly: "Everyone can be taught to sculpt:
Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is with the
great programmers".


So go ahead and buy that Java book; you'll probably get some use out of it.
But you won't change your life, or your real overall expertise as a
programmer in 24 hours, days, or even months.

Approximate timing for various operations on a typical 1GHz PC in  2001:

execute single instruction  1 nanosec = (1/1,000,000,000) sec
fetch word from L1 cache memory  2 nanosec
fetch word from main memory  10 nanosec 
fetch word from consecutive disk location  200 nanosec
fetch word from new disk location (seek)  8,000,000 nanosec = 8 millisec

 


Appendix: Language Choice

Several people have asked what programming language they should learn first.
There is no one answer, but consider these points:




Use your friends. When asked "what operating system should
I use, Windows, Unix, or Mac?", my answer is usually: "use whatever
your friends use."  The advantage you get from learning from your
friends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or
between programming languages.  Also consider your future friends:
the community of programmers that you will be a part of if you
continue.  Does your chosen language have a large growing community
or a small dying one?  Are there books, web sites, and online forums
to get answers from?  Do you like the people in those forums?

Keep it simple.  Programming languages such as C++
and Java are designed for professional development by large teams of
experienced programmers who are concerned about the run-time efficiency of
their code.
As a result, these languages have complicated parts designed for these circumstances.
You're concerned with learning to program.  You don't need that complication.
You want a language that was designed to be easy to learn and remember by a
single new programmer.

Play. Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the
normal, interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key,
or "batch" mode, in which you only hear the notes after you finish a whole song?
Clearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for the piano, and also for 
programming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it.



Given these criteria, my recommendations for a first programming
language would be Python or
Scheme.  But your
circumstances may vary, and there are other good choices. If your
age is a single-digit, you might prefer
Alice or Squeak (older learners might also enjoy these). The important
thing is that you choose and get started.



Appendix: Books and Other Resources


Several people have asked what books and web pages they should learn
from.  I repeat that "book learning alone won't be enough" but I can
recommend the following:



 Scheme: Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson &amp; Sussman) is
probably the best introduction to computer science, and it does
teach programming as a way of understanding the computer science. 
You can see online videos of lectures on this book, as well as the complete text online. The book is
challenging and will weed out some people who perhaps could be
successful with another approach.  

 Scheme:
How to
Design Programs (Felleisen et al.) is one of the best books
on how to actually design programs in an elegant and functional way.

 Python: 
Python Programming:
An Intro to CS (Zelle) is a good introduction using Python.  

 Python: Several
online tutorials
 are available at Python.org.

 Oz: Concepts,
Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming (Van Roy &amp; Haridi)
is seen by some as the modern-day successor to Abelson &amp; Sussman.
It is a tour through the big ideas of programming, covering a wider
range than Abelson &amp; Sussman while being perhaps easier to read and
follow.  It uses a language, Oz, that is not widely known but serves as
a basis for learning other languages.







Notes
T. Capey points out that the Complete
  Problem Solver page on Amazon now has the "Teach Yourself
  Bengali in 21 days" and "Teach Yourself Grammar and Style" books under the
  "Customers who shopped for this item also shopped for these items"
  section.  I guess that a large portion of the people who look at that
  book are coming from this page.

            About Us
               Alaska Tour &amp; Travel is the largest custom vacation packaging
                company in Alaska. Since 1995 we have helped more than 100,000
                visitors plan their Alaska vacations - each trip customized to meet
                their individual needs. We choose and inspect each of our suppliers
                carefully, utilizing only the most reputable firms in the
                industry. Alaska Tour &amp; Travel represents top Alaska tourism
                suppliers offering Alaska lodging choices such as the Denali Princess Lodge, and popular day trip operators like Kenai Fjords Tours. And no
                other travel company in Alaska sells more independent Alaska Railroad trips, or offers lower rail prices.  And remember... there are no
                markups built into any Alaska Tour &amp; Travel package--not true with
                many of our competitors.

      An API, or Java Application Programming Interface, are collections of classes and
          interfaces that help make programming easier. The APIs give us many predefined classes
          so we can build our individual programs, reusing popular components like Lists, graphics,
          etc.  These APIs explain to us these classes, their methods, and fields.
          This section contains the core Java APIs (Java 1.02 through Java 1.5), specialized APIs
          (Java3D, PersonalJava, etc.), APIs for Java Enterprise Edition the official Java language

CGI Programming 101: Learn CGI Today!

CGI Programming 101 will show you how to add guestbooks, page counters, shopping carts and other interactive elements to your website. CGI programming is easy to learn; if you know HTML, you can learn CGI. You don't need any prior programming experience.
See what people are saying about CGI Programming 101!


Getting Started
You'll need a few things before you can start writing CGI programs. You'll need a web server, for one. Chances are good that your current web host or ISP already supports CGI programs, but if you aren't sure, ask them. 
This book is geared towards Unix, but you can easily set up 
Apache and Perl on Mac and Windows. I've written several tutorials of 
how to get started; choose the one that's right for you:

    Windows XP: how to 
    set up Apache and Perl; how to configure Apache; where to write your 
    programs; differences between CGI programs on XP and Unix
    Mac OS X: how to configure
    Apache (which you already have installed); where to write your programs
    Unix: How to upload programs
    to your Unix-based ISP; Unix tutorial; 
    where to write your programs; Unix permissions.



Once you've gotten your server set up, you're ready to start writing
CGI programs. Start with the Introduction:



  Introduction - What is CGI? Why
      learn it? What do you need to get started?
  Chapter 1: Getting Started
      [text] [programs] 
      - where to
      write your programs; how to upload to the Unix host; changing permissions;
      writing your first CGI
  Chapter 2: Perl Variables 
  [text] [programs] 
  - Scalars, arrays, and hashes
  Chapter 3: CGI Environment Variables 
 [text] [programs]  
  - Using data from environment variables; writing forms using GET
  Chapter 4: Processing Forms and Sending Mail
  [text] [programs] 
    -  Writing forms using POST: a form-to-mail CGI
  Chapter 5: Advanced Forms and Perl Control Structures
  [text] [programs] 
    -  Handling radio buttons, checkboxes, and select fields; writing a
      survey/poll CGI
  Chapter 6: Reading and Writing Data Files
  [text] [programs] 
    -  File permissions; how to open, read, write, and close files
   
       The first six chapters are also available as a printable PDF file (78 pages, 609K).
       


When you're ready to go beyond the online class, order the book and learn how to work with MySQL databases, how to build your own shopping cart, how to password-protect your site, and more. (You can view the source code for all of the projects in the book using the links below.)

C Programming


C Programming





The notes on these pages
are for the courses in C Programming 
I
used to
teach
in the
Experimental College
at the University of Washington
in Seattle, WA.
Normally these notes accompany
fairly traditional classroom lecture presentations,
but they are intended to be reasonably complete
(more so, for that matter, than the lectures!)
and should be usable as standalone tutorials.
I originally designed the first, Introductory course
around The C Programming Language (2nd 
Edition) by Kernighan and Ritchie, and the notes were designed to 
complement that text, highlighting important points and explaining 
subtleties which might be lost on the general reader.
Later, I rewrote
the notes to stand on their own
(in part because, in spite of the first set of notes,
too many of my students found K&amp;R a bit too technical for an 
informal, introductory course).
Finally,
I occasionally teach
an Intermediate course,
which covers the topics which tend to be skipped or glossed over in introductory courses
(bitwise operators, structures, file I/O, etc.).
The Intermediate course
has its own set of notes.
All three
sets of notes are available here.
If you have a copy of K&amp;R2
and would like a thorough
treatment of the language,
read K&amp;R and the ``Notes to Accompany K&amp;R'' side by side.
If you're just getting your feet wet
and would like a somewhat simpler introduction,
read the ``Introductory Class Notes.''
If you have had an introduction to C
(either here or elsewhere)
and are now looking to fill in some of the missing pieces,
read the ``Intermediate Class Notes.''
Of course, just reading a book or these notes
won't really teach you C;
you will also want to write and run your own programs,
for practice and so that
the language concepts

will make some kind of practical sense.
Most of my
programming assignments
(including review questions)
are
here as well,
along with their solution sets.
(No peeking at the answers
until you've given the problems your best shot!)
These notes are arranged for the web in the usual hierarchy by section and subsection.
If you want to read through all of them,
without keeping track of your own stack to implement a depth-first tree traversal,
just follow the ``read sequentially'' links at the bottom of each page.
Depending on your background,
you might want to read one or both of the two preliminary handouts:
one on programming in general,
and one which reviews some math which is relevant to programming.
(And there are some other miscellaneous handouts, too.)
One note about the HTML:
these pages were produced automatically from the base manuscripts for my class notes,
using a program of my own devising which is,
all too typically,
not (yet?) perfect.
I apologize in advance for any formatting glitches.
In particular, when you see
&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;sub&gt;...&lt;/sub&gt;
in the text,
these do not represent bugs in your browser
or accidental bugs in my markup;
instead, these are my interim compromise way
of representing superscripts and subscripts to you,
since there's no way to do so in portable HTML.

Finally, I realize that
reading these notes on the net is not always as convenient as it might be,
particularly when the net is slow.
Please realize, though, that the net is what it is,
and that I have gone to a certain amount of effort
to place these notes here at all.
Please do not ask me to send you a set of these notes
for browsing on your own machine,
as I am currently unable to do so.

Extreme Programming: A Gentle Introduction.















  


Extreme Programming:
A gentle introduction 


 














The first
Extreme Programming project was started March 6,
1996. Extreme Programming is one of several popular Agile
Processes. It has already been proven to be very successful
at many companies of all different sizes and industries world wide.
Extreme
Programming
is successful because it stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of
delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far
in the future this
process delivers the software you need as you
need it. Extreme Programming empowers your developers to confidently
respond to changing
customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.
Extreme
Programming emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and
developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. Extreme
Programming implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling
teams to become highly productive. The team
self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as
possible.

Extreme
Programming
improves a software project in five essential ways; communication,
simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. Extreme
Programmers
constantly communicate
with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design
simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting
on day one. They deliver the system to
the customers as early as
possible and implement changes as suggested. Every small success
deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every
team member. With this foundation
Extreme Programmers are able to courageously respond to changing
requirements
and technology.
The
most surprising aspect of ExtremeProgramming
is its simple
rules. Extreme
Programming is a lot like a jig saw puzzle. There are many small
pieces. Individually the pieces




make no sense, but when combined
together a complete picture can be seen. The rules may seem awkward and
perhaps even naive at first,
but are based on sound values
and principles.
Our
rules
set expectations between team members but are not the end goal
themselves. You will come to realize these
rules define an environment that promotes team collaboration and
empowerment, that is your goal. Once achieved productive teamwork will
continue even as
rules are changed to fit your company's specific needs.
This
flow
chart
shows how Extreme Programming's rules work together. Customers enjoy
being partners in the
software process, developers actively contribute regardless of
experience level, and managers concentrate on communication and
relationships. Unproductive
activities have been trimmed
to reduce costs and frustration of everyone involved.
Take
a
guided
tour of Extreme Programming by following the trail of littlebuttons,
starting here.

The event brought together over 900 conference, media, and speaking attendees and over 2,000 expo attendees for three days of exploring the flourishing Chinese game development scene with a diverse lineup of more than 60 speakers and more than 50 sessions. As the &#111;nly government ministry responsible for management of industry bases, project development, conferences and trade fairs, and market oversight for the animation and &#111;nline gaming industries, the Ministry of Culture of the P.R. of China (MOC) officially endorsed GDC China and sent delegates to interact with the development community.Read More.. | 0 Comments	Wednesday, October 14, 2009	  The Daily GameDev.net  	Posted by: 	Oli Wilkinson at 12:19:36 PMAMD graphics in the next XBox?: At least that's the rumour circulating from Fudzilla, who also claim we can see the next system in 2012.

Finally I had cornered it in a wooded clearing, and sat &#111;n a nearby rock in order to prepare for the arduous task of striking down and preparing the news so I could later serve it up to my hungry audience.

This week is a brief lull before the massive flood of releases that will saturation bomb the rest of 2009, but at least there's Brutal Legend, Uncharted 2 and A Boy and His Blob.

Dante's Inferno has had a lot of ink spilled over its frankly idiotic marketing campaign, but we're getting close to the point where the proof is actually in the pudding. It's being developed by some of the same people who put together Dead Space, which was a definite highlight of 2008, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.

What about that Planetside sequel? If you're &#111;ne of the not-very-many players who played the original game, you probably will be excited to hear that it's going to be called Planetside Next. That's kind of a stupid-sounding name, but it apparently has really massive battles.

In indie news, Star Guard is a surprisingly tough platformer that needs some of your love. There's even a Mac version, which is pretty much how people gain my instant affection. Don't fail the Star Guard!

More &#111;n this at the end of the Daily.

Do you know what kind of games are neat? Western games. Through this logic I bring you Red Dead Revolver. It looks neat. That's about it for this story.

Halo 3: ODST sold 2.5 million copies in its first two weeks. That's a pretty respectable number for a game which was often referred to as "just" an expansion pack. Given that Bungie developed the game in roughly fourteen months, I imagine the sales of the game are pleasing. ODST brought in, thus far, $125M in revenue (compared to the $170M of Halo 3 &#111;n its first day). It's hard to think of Halo as anything but a game destined for success, but I'm really glad that ODST did well; it's a superb game (that I feel is better than any of the other Halo games). You should probably check it out if you haven't already. The campaign is enjoyable, but the co-op Firefight is absolutely brilliant.

I was planning &#111;n writing about the demise of Shaba Studios since Spider-Man: Web of Shadows was &#111;ne of the best Spider-Man games I've ever played and the demise of Shaba is unfortunate. I would have waxed lyrically about this story and probably made some poignant observations about the life and times in the game industry. I may have even broken down in tears at some point, who's to say? I cannot, however, do any of this. You may ask: Why, Trent, can you not do this? I'll tell you the answer: Drew Sikora stole my story. That's right. Get the hate mail ready kids, we're not going to take this abusive treatment anymore.

This is what I have to resort to &#111;n a slow news day. It was either mocking Drew or making up some sensational story.

So, uh. I guess Rock Band for iPhone is going to be a thing. I wonder how many broken iPhones will occur as a result of this application. I am simultaneously sad and happy that people can't sing into their iPhones for the vocal section, though. I'm sure I'd hate it for the most part, but I'd have an amazing icebreaker if some gorgeous woman &#111;n my bus started doing it. "Hey, you like singing into your iPhone?", I'd ask. She'd continue singing as if to say yes to my question. "Well, that's such a coincidence, because you and I should go get dinner some time!" Flawless plan.

Bioware wants to do the gaming industry a favor with Dragon Age and remind the world how not to do downloadable content. Release-day DLC is a terrible thing.

After all of the Mobigames and Langdellian drama, Edge is back &#111;n the iPhone App Store. Check it out! I was lucky enough to get the game before all of these shenanigans went down and it's a joyous game. It's no Canabalt, but it's close.

Australia wants to remind the world that the act of killing is acceptable, but not blood or gore. Unlike the standard release of Left 4 Dead, the edited Australian release of Left 4 Dead does not contain "pictures of decapitation, dismemberment, wound detail or piles of bodies lying about the environment." Remember, kids. Killing is okay so long as you don't see any of the repercussions!

And that brings us to the end of this lovely GameDev.net. I'm going to urge you all to go out and buy Demon's Souls. It's an absolutely brilliant Action/RPG for Playstation 3 developed by From Software and published by Atlus and Sony. If you're &#111;n the fence (and don't mind the spoilers contained within) you should check out part &#111;ne and part two of my three-part Demon's Soul write-up of my experiences with the game. The &#111;nly other game I've done something like this for is Far Cry 2 and, as we all know, that was basically the game of the decade.Read More.. | 8 Comments	Thursday, October 8, 2009	  The Daily GameDev.net  	Posted by: 	Drew Sikora at 10:46:56 AMHowdy folks! This week I'm going to remember to re-read the Daily's of my fellow editors so half the stuff I post isn't a rehash from earlier in the week. Not that a reminder (or few) isn't always a bad thing, however.

Studio News - Activision, Emergent, Valve, Sulake. Heads are rolling in the Activision empire &#111;nce again as the publisher closes down Spider-man: Web of Shadows developer Shaba Games (which includes around 30 employees) and a developer which they recently purchased, 7 Studios was forced to lay off 30 people (eerie coincidence?) due to a studio "realignment". This is, by the way, from a company that was &#111;ne of Inc. Magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies in 2007. The Layoff Report unfortunately continues with Habbo Hotel developer Sulake letting go of around 20% of it's staff, or 40 people. Nope, can't stop yet - Emergent has announced that it will be "restructuring its businesses", which it admitted meant that an unknown amount of people will be let go. Maybe some of these people will seek out newly-founded mobile games studio Tarver Games, co-founded by Chris Cross, game design director for the Medal of Honor series. Finally, and as a reminder to you all what a great idea modding is for budding developers, Valve has hired the developer behind the Warcraft III mod Defense of the Ancients.

Randy Pitchford and Brad Wardell throw down the gauntlets. Both Randy Pitchford (Gearbox head) and Brad Wardell (Stardock head) had some choice words to say about certain game services from Valve and Microsoft this past week. We'll start with Randy, who, in an interview with MaximumPC, blasted Valve for taking advantage of its grip &#111;n the digital indie market with Steam and in the process "exploiting a lot of small guys." Who are these small guys? He doesn't say. He does suggest that Valve and Steam become totally seperate business entities because "There's so much conflict of interest there that it's horrid. It's actually really, really dangerous for the rest of the industry to allow Valve to win." We can expect to hear lots more &#111;n this story, both from Valve and (hopefully) the "small guys".

In regards to Microsoft, Brad Wardell appears to have gotten completely fed up with Games for Windows Live to the point that, should the platform gain PC dominance, he would no longer consider making PC games. At all. It appears that his well-justified anger comes out of the Live team over at Microsoft forcing console standards &#111;n PC games, which is rather silly considering the technical differences of the platforms. It's almost as if they (*gasp*) want every PC game created for the platform to be relatively easy to port over to Xbox.

Class action lawsuit hits Sony over v3.0 firmware. Apparently someone got pissed off enough at Sony for ruining his console after upgrading to the new 3.0 firmware (and being charged $150 to get it fixed) that he filed a class action suit alleging that Sony is guilty of (among other things) breach of implied warranty, negligence, and negligence misrepresentation. The defendant claims that "thousands of Sony PS3 video game owners" were similarly affected, although it's unclear how many of those thousands ended up in his position with a completely bricked (so he claims) console. Many &#111;nly reported controller issues and game freezing. We'll see how Sony responds.

Follow up: Japanese Game industry in decline. Last week I mentioned that Capcom's Keiji Inafune admitted to losing faith in his country's industry, and TGS showed a noticeable drop in attendance. This week, a report shows that the Japanese game market experienced a 10.5% fall over the first half of fiscal 2009.

Daily Remainders - more cool stories that didn't make the cut along with game dev articles/features.

Indie game maker Phil Fish (Fez) has already expressed how much love infuses the Indie Games community, but it was proven beyond a doubt this past week when Edmund McMillen (Gish, Aether, etc) had to be rushed to the hospital to have his gall bladder removed. The support from the Indie community was immediate and overwhelming. In a note &#111;n Facebook (after the successful surgery), Ed expressed:
"I appreciate every single amount of effort you've all put into the kind words you've sent me and money you've donated. I didn't expect anything like this at all, being in a drug addled haze for the past 5 days and waking up to something like this was beyond moving and brought me to tears many times. I love all of you guys and hope to repay you all in some way eventually."His wife, Danielle, also deserves credit for hijacking his Facebook account to let everyone know what was going &#111;n.

And lastly, for some video entertainment, you're definitely going to want to check out the short indie film TURBO, which is about a futuristic 4D fighting game. The story is good, the acting is good, but the choreography is pretty stunning for such a project. Then again, they are Koreans. Enjoy!

I can't help with the pie, but I can help with Wednesday's GameDev.Net daily. So here we go.

 The 2bn+ app downloads reported last week show that the iPhone market has taken off in a huge way, opening the doors for many smaller studios to thrive. But what if you're a Flash developer? Perhaps you're feeling a little left out of the loop - perhaps you feel as if you'd love to sell your cool little games &#111;n the iPhone and make some money... well come in out of the cold, as Adobe used Max 2009 to announce that Flash CS5 will compile Flash directly to native iPhone format. That's native, not interpreted - and according to the Adobe Flash CS5 FAQ, you can use both Windows and Mac to do this, although you'll still need an iPhone developer licence. Edge Magazine have an article covering the story and speak to several iPhone and Flash developers for thier opinions.

 Interested in getting into the Game Industry? You might find some use for Edge magazine's ezine &#111;n the subject.  It covers all areas and interviews some key people in those fields to give you some advice &#111;n what they're looking for. As the preamble says, there's recurring theme about using platforms like the iPhone for people to break into the industry - so it's worth a read if you're thinking about getting &#111;n board.
 
Digital Distribution is a Good Thing - three leading memebers of Bungie think so having jumped ship to form Moonshot Games and aim to keep devlivering high quality downloadable games.  

 Don McCabe, the Managing Director of  UK independent games chain "Chips" thinks that the PSPgo will "fail miserably" - although he doesn't detail why. He believes that when it crashes, it'll "put back other potential people coming into that digital space". The PSPgo has has a slow start in the UK and several retailers have already dropped the price to 199.99. The PSPgo does seem to have caused a little contention in the retail establishments.

 The upcoming London Games Conference will approach the subject of digital distribution with several key players talking about the subject. The full lineup of talks is available here, if you're interested in the subject it definitely looks worthwhile dropping along if you can.

 Also Worth checking out is MCV's interview with Valve's Jason Holtman &#111;n the rise of Steam as a platform. In the article, Holtman talks about how publisher ownership of sales figures makes it difficult for Steam to publish sales charts. C'mon guys, play nice.

 Mobile gaming isn't just a fad in developed countries - India is getting more involved in the act as the recent Gamasutra article shows. The market still sounds immature, but the main thing of interest in India is the social network space, so it could be that area that games see having the biggest growth. 

 Who remember's Revolution's Beneath a Steel Sky? It was an Amiga classic and it's back in remastered form &#111;n the iPhone/iPod Touch. With Lucas Arts releasing Monkey Island a few months back, the point and click adventure fan inside me is very happy. Now if &#111;nly Simon The Sorcerer would come...!

 UK indie studio FourDoorLemon have had great crital success with their recent quiz game, QuizQuizQuiz. They've now slashed the price to a trivial $0.99/0.59. Ok bad joke, I know.

 Remember the iPhone game EDGE? You know, the &#111;ne that caused all sorts of toys to be thrown out of all sorts of prams... well it's back &#111;n the App Store. Let's see what infamy does to their sales figures!Read More.. | 2 Comments	Tuesday, October 6, 2009	  The Daily GameDev.Net  	Posted by: 	Promit Roy at 3:48:17 PMIt's a House Cleaning GameDev.Net Daily! Everybody, start putting all your stuff back in cabinets and in the basement where they belong! ...Yeah, I forgot about the Daily again. Let's get &#111;n with it.

Indie games. They're frequently awesome, and with the rise of digital distribution some of them are actually getting the attention they deserve. &#79;n GamaSutra, they've posted a Best of Indie Games, put together by the editor of IndieGames.com. Tower defense? Check. A new game from Jeff Minter? Check. Blowing up cats? Check plus.

Apparently reviewers just can't be bothered when it comes to the Wii. Then again, have you looked at your typical store shelf full of Nintendo-platform games? Ugh. Imagine: Pet Doctor? I think not. It does more or less explain the rising average scores of Wii games -- because, you know. That's such a useful statistic.

Turns out RAM sucks, or at least motherboards do. The worst part? These dismal numbers are from Google's servers, which use ECC RAM. Your computer? Well, it's probably a crippled mess that runs &#111;nly through a miraculous game of odds.

In other news, women are basically better when it comes to space programs. But you know, the 50s and all; women's liberation wasn't exactly up to speed yet. Oh, and the most common password &#111;n Hotmail really is the &#111;ne off your suitcase or air shield. Go figure.Read More.. | 1 Comments  November Game Investment Conference to Bring Investors, Studios Together  	Posted by: 	Game Path at 3:14:08 PMInvestors looking for guidance about the market, or interested in seeing hot new IP in development at indie and established studios should attend Game Paths Game Investment Conference (GIC), scheduled for Monday  Tuesday, Nov. 2-3, 2009 at the San Jose Marriott, San Jose, Calif.Read More.. | 0 Comments  Certified Scrum Master for Game Developers Course in San Francisco November 10-11  	Posted by: 	Clinton Keith at 8:47:26 AMAre you looking to energize your teams, reduce costs and increase performance?

After two days of nonstop programming and creative design efforts, 11 game entries were submitted by teams ranging in size from 3 to 5 members. Teams were competing for a grand prize which includes $2,500, J.Fold merchandise and future distribution.Read More.. | 0 Comments	Monday, October 5, 2009	  First Annual Independent Games Festival China Announces Finalists  	Posted by: 	Drew Sikora at 6:03:00 PMOrganizers of the inaugural Independent Games Festival China (IGF China) have revealed that over 100 entries were received for the first-ever showcase of Asia-Pacific indie games, and finalists have now been decided for both the Main and Student competitions, with winners revealed next week at GDC China in Shanghai.

Chinese submissions for the first-ever independent games event targeting this area -- a newly formed sister event to the main yearly IGF in San Francisco -- were received from Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Jiang Su Province, Guang Dong Province, Sichuan Province, and Zhejiang. In addition, overseas submissions from Asian, Asia-Pacific and Australasian nations including the Philippines, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Pakistan, Australia, Iran, South Korea and India were considered. 

Finalists were chosen by a panel of distinguished local judges, including representatives from IGDA Shanghai, FZD School of Design, Activision and many more. IGF China winners will be showcased at the GDC China event, and are eligible to win up to RMB20,000 ($3,000) in cash prizes, awards, and All Access Passes to GDC San Francisco 2010.Read More.. | 0 Comments  The Daily GameDev.net  	Posted by: 	Mike Stedman at 9:55:26 AMThe mysteries of the GDNet Daily are &#111;nly revealed to a select few each year. We pull children from orphanages, hospitals, their mothers' arms, and bring them to our secret GDNet testing facility, where they play many intricate simulations in order to prepare for pan-galactic war with the true originators of the Daily. Then some git wrote a book about it and the government told us to cut it out or else. That's basically how I got this job, though, so I'm not complaining. Having to work inside the Daily factory is quite uncomfortable, however, as all the doors are &#111;nly tall enough for these children and I have to bend over quite far to get inside or leave the building.

In the bloody aftermath of TGS 2009, news is scarce. There's updates about Little Big Planet PSP, Modern Warfare 2, the PC version of Borderlands, the imminent release of the Dragon Age character creator, Zombie Driver, Max Payne 3 and Battlefield 1943 for the PC. I don't normally go in for the plastic guitar game genre, but I figure it's my civic duty to announce that there are a bunch of Queen songs coming to the Rock Band platform.

Did you forget about IndieCade 2009? I did, unfortunately. Like last year, it's a collection of games which are beautiful, have novel control methods, or are simply bastard hard. If you have the opportunity, try out some of the titles linked from there - I want to play Sowlar, which reminds me of the classic Hovver Bovver for some odd reason.

Is there controversy to be had in the industry lately? No, actually. It's been surprisingly dull. The most I can find is that a dude who wears a mask to football games is angry because he was included in a Madden title without his permission. EA Sports are perhaps getting too big for their britches, as you can see with this obviously factual documentary evidence of a man getting beaten up. You know what they say - with great office ball-pits comes great responsibility for catching a fist in the face from a large scary man. With this utter lack of revolutionary controversy, you can now feel good about sitting &#111;n your duff and getting a higher and higher score in Gridrunner Revolution, which you absolutely should.

How far has our industry gone? It's gone so far that a man who submitted this cover letter to LucasArts' game development studio is now appearing &#111;n late night TV.

Before you go today, check out the Crazies trailer. It's nominally a remake of the 1973 Romero film, but it's got a fairly vicious tone to it, even compared to the other Romero remakes as of late. I can't wait!Read More.. | 3 Comments	Saturday, October 3, 2009	  5 great new articles up on Industrybroadcast  	Posted by: 	Ryan Wiancko at 1:46:49 AMIndustrybroadcast.com is happy to announce another wisdom packed selection of articles from some of the biggest names in the games industry!!

Journal Land Pick of the Week

Promit's Ventspace - Promit walks through a SlimDX crash bug caused by a "problematic subtlety" in .NET. Can you see where they went wrong in the code? Also, his team's iPhone game Aves made the New and Noteworthy apps hotlist

I want to start out this post by first recognizing how incredibly gorgeous Kristen Bell is; Kristen, if you're out there, I'd like to ask you out to dinner! That all said, the next step in this GameDev.net Daily is to recognize how incredibly awkward digitized Kristen Bell looks. She was in the first game as well and although Assassin's Creed 2 Kristen Bell looks far better, it's still fairly awkward. Uncanny Valley'd.

Okay, admittedly, digitized Kristen Bell is still kind of adorable.

PushButton Labs has acquired The Incredible Machine IP! The game is now &#111;n GOG as well.

Go! The PSP Go was released this week and the Playstation Store has been updated with all sorts of games that can be downloaded &#111;nto Sony's new UMD-less PSP. The platform hits shelves with a price tag of $249.99 US and comes with 16GB of internal flash memory. I really want a PSP Go, but I can't quite justify the price given that I already have a PSP 2000 (everyone made the PSP Stop joke; I avoided it). I really, really want a PSP Go, though. I'll gladly let someone buy &#111;ne for me. I would get a lot of use out of it! Like instead of looking idly (and playing Canabalt &#111;n my iPhone) when a police officer did a sweep of the bus I was &#111;n this evening for drugs or a felon or something, I could have been playing my PSP Go &#111;n the go! Think of the potential in me, Internet.

Indie first-person "shooter" (more first person melee fighter) Zeno Clash is &#111;n its way to Xbox Live Arcade! If you're not excited about this right now, you should be. If you didn't play this video game when it was &#111;n Steam, you either could do that right now or you could wait for the Xbox Live Arcade port. I would recommend either, really. It's a fantastic game. Completely insane. And fantastic. Also insane.

The Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA) announced that they formed a group called the "Gamers for Digital Rights." This group has the stated goal of providing "tools and resources that will help protect the rights of video game consumers today." I. Uh. Okay? The group's formation came with more information, thankfully: "The importance of this issue is mounting, as we move from a packaged goods model, where we own what we buy, to a digitally-distributed model, where we may have a license for what we buy." Oohhhhh, that makes sense. I'm not sure I see the need for a group for this, but &#111;nly time will tell &#111;n that front. Groups are awesome for the game industry; remember that time we talked about the PC Gaming Alliance? Those were good times.

After spending far too much time last weekend playing the excellent Halo 3: ODST (which makes for interesting discussion!) and Need for Speed: Shift, I'm looking forward to doing something new this weekend. Like maybe playing Resident Evil 5 or finishing my solo insane play-through of Gears of War. Really branching out, you know? Also, for any of you Texas in the audience: help a newcomer to the city of Austin figure out fun things to do. I live through suggestions.Read More.. | 7 Comments	Thursday, October 1, 2009	  gDEBugger V5.3: introducing gDEBugger iPhone with Windows & Mac 64-bit support  	Posted by: 	Drew Sikora at 4:06:46 PMGraphic Remedy is proud to announce the release of gDEBugger Version 5.3 for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and iPhone!

Studio News - Openings, Layoffs, Retail. Epic Games is opening up another studio abroad, this time in Japan. Currently, the studio is set to carry out regional support duties like the South Korea studio. Sony &#79;nline Entertainment has opened up its Usability Lab for external use, offering services that include usability testing, heuristic evaluations, focus groups and product evaluations. This was the lab they used with the 5-million player-strong Free Realms. True Games has opened a new studio in Austin to focus &#111;n premium &#111;nline micro-transaction content. Being that they are a new studio, they are of course hiring people. Hello Games says hello with a dev diary and the announcement of their upcoming game Joe Danger. Square Enix has been rumored to be planning to lay off between 200-300 staff. Given the lack up updates &#111;n this story and no denial by Squeenix, things aren't looking too good. Funcom, developer behind Age of Conan, has been forced to cut its staff by 20% in it's Norwegian studio, in order to "better align the company's operations to the current marketplace." It has also pushed back the release of its next MMOG by "some months." Transmission Games, though hot &#111;n the heels of a chart-topping release, had to cut 20+ people from the team. Reasons for the redundancies are still unknown at this time. Game Crazy isn't a studio, it's a retailer, but it's still worth mentioning that 200 of its stores will be closing across the US. Why is this worth mentioning? Sales, people!! Markdowns start at 30%.

TGS shows dip in attendance, Japanese industry in trouble?. Following the trend of downward attendance across the board for most consumer and industry shows this year (there have been some exceptions), Tokyo Games show reported numbers that cut 5% from previous year's attendance. If that wasn't bad enough, how about Capcom's Keiji Inafune stating, at an end-of-show panel, that "Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished." Owchness :( Additionally, dates for the 2010 TGS don't seem to appear beneficial to the trade show either. Time will tell, as always. 

Apps: 2 billion served. Do the pinky. You know you want to. 2... *pinky* billion apps. Yes, and now that Apple's hit 2 billion app downloads they're already climbing to 3... and beyond of course. But another number that's of interest to us game developers is this: 20% of all those apps are games. This is the single largest app category available in the store. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. We're games, and we're a big deal.

Daily Remainders - more cool stories that didn't make the cut along with game dev articles/features.

So you ever get bored of that rectangular crate that sits under or atop your desk and holds all your PC components within its austere, metal shell? Yea, me too. Which is kinda why it's surprising that this hasn't come along earlier - the Thermaltake Level 10. Now here's a case you have no excuse to hide under your desk or behind some cabinet.

If somehow haven't seen the amazing live-action Halo ODST trailer yet, then be sure you watch it before or after checking out this Making Of video.

Why is Tim Schafer awesome? This is why Tim Schafer is awesome. And now you can be awesome like Tim Schafer too. Maybe. Well, he at least helps you try to be awesome like him. It's a start.

I'm not going to whine about the fact that I still haven't had a chance to play the Uncharted 2 Multiplayer Demo and instead ask if anyone has a Google Wave invite or few to spare? I could use at least three to get the GDNet ops team up and running to check out the new service. We'll love you forever!! Or give you a year's worth of GDNet+. Unconditional love... or GDNet+. Your choice.

Job
for scientific research programmer at Genetic Programming Inc. (posted July 8,
2007)







Genetic programming (GP) is an automated method for
creating a working computer program from a high-level problem statement of a
problem. Genetic programming starts from a high-level statement of what needs
to be done and automatically creates a computer program to solve the problem. 

There are now 36 instances
where genetic programming has automatically produced a result that is
competitive with human performance, including 15 instances where genetic programming has
created an entity that either infringes or duplicates the functionality of a
previously patented 20th-century invention, 6 instances where
genetic programming has done the same with respect to a 21st-centry
invention, and 2 instances where genetic programming has created a patentable
new invention. 

Given these results, we say that Genetic programming now routinely delivers
high-return human-competitive machine intelligence. Click here for our
definitions of human-competitive, high return and
the AI ratio (artificial-to-intelligence ratio), routine, and machine
intelligence. This statement is the most important point of the 2003
book Genetic
Programming IV: Routine
Human-Competitive Machine Intelligence. Click here to read chapter 1 of Genetic
Programming IV in PDF format. Click here for 2004 awards for
human-competitive results (based on presentations at the GECCO-2004
conference in Seattle
on June 27, 2004).

The fact that genetic programming can evolve entities that are competitive
with human-produced results suggests that genetic
programming can be used as an automated invention machine to create new
and useful patentable inventions. In acting as an invention machine,
evolutionary methods, such as genetic programming, have the advantage of not
being encumbered by preconceptions that limit human problem-solving to well-troden paths. Genetic programming has delivered a progression of
qualitatively more substantial results in synchrony with five
approximately order-of-magnitude increases in the expenditure of computer time
(over the 15-year period from 1987 to 2002). 

Genetic programming has 16 important attributes that one would reasonably
expect of a system for automatic
programming (sometimes also called program synthesis or program
induction). Genetic programming has seven important
differences from conventional approaches to artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML). For additional information, click here for PowerPoint
(PPT) presentation on genetic programming (about 5 Megabytes) similar
to that presented at the 2003 Accelerating Change Conference on September 13,
2003 and similar to the overview lecture given on September 24, 2003 in John
Kozas course at Stanford University on genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic
programming (GP).







How Genetic Programming (GP) Works

Genetic programming starts with a primordial ooze of thousands of randomly
created computer programs. This population of programs is progressively evolved
over a series of generations. The evolutionary search uses the Darwinian
principle of natural selection (survival of the fittest) and analogs of various
naturally occurring operations, including crossover (sexual recombination),
mutation, gene duplication, gene deletion. Genetic programming sometimes also
employs developmental processes by which an embryo grows into fully developed
organism. Old Chinese saying says animated gif is worth one mega-word, so click here
for short tutorial of What is GP? including about two dozen animated gifs.
This short tutorial contains a discussion of the preparatory steps
of a run of genetic programming, the executional steps (that is, the flowchart of genetic
programming), an illustrative
simple run of genetic programming for a problem of symbolic regression
of a quadratic polynomial, a discussion of developmental
genetic programming for the automatic synthesis of both the topology
and sizing of analog electrical circuits (potentially also including placement
and routing), and the use of a turtle to draw complex structures (such as
antenna). In addition, genetic programming can automatically create, in a
single run, a general (parameterized) solution to a problem in the form of a
graphical structure whose nodes or edges represent components and where the
parameter values of the components are specified by mathematical expressions
containing free variables. That is, genetic programming can automatically
create a general solution to a problem in the form of a parameterized
topology. 







Information about the Field of Genetic Programming (GP) and the Field of
Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (GEC)

The technique of genetic programming (GP) is one of the techniques of the
field of genetic and evolutionary computation (GEC) which, in turn, includes
techniques such as genetic algorithms (GA), evolution strategies (ES),
evolutionary programming (EP), grammatical evolution (GE), and machine code
(linear genome) genetic programming.

Applications of Genetic Programming

There are numerous applications of genetic programming including 


 black art problems,
     such as the automated synthesis of analog electrical circuits,
     controllers, antennas, networks of chemical reactions, and other areas of
     design, 
 programming the unprogrammable (PTU) involving the automatic
     creation of computer programs for unconventional computing devices such as
     cellular automata, multi-agent systems, parallel systems,
     field-programmable gate arrays, field-programmable analog arrays, ant
     colonies, swarm intelligence, distributed systems, and the like, 
 commercially usable new
     inventions (CUNI) involving the use of genetic programming as an automated
     &quot;invention machine&quot; for creating commercially usable new
     inventions, and 


We are constantly looking for new domain areas in which to apply the
techniques of genetic programming to achieve human-competitive machine
intelligence.







Parallelization of Genetic Programming

In July 1999, Genetic Programming Inc. started operating a new 1,000-node
Beowulf-style parallel cluster computer consisting of 1,000 Pentium II 350 MHz
processors and a host computer. Click here for technical discussion of parallel genetic
programming and building the 1,000-Pentium
Beowulf-style parallel cluster computer. About half of the 36
human-competitive results produced by genetic programming were obtained using computing
systems that were substantially smaller than the 1,000-Pentium computer
mentioned above. Fifteen of these human-competitive results were obtained on a
1995-vintage parallel computer system composed of 64 PowerPC 80 MHz processors
with a spec95fp rating. This 1995-vintage computer has total computational
power equal to only about 1/60 of that of the 1000-Pentium machine mentioned
above. Five of these results were obtained on a 70-Alpha machine (whose
spec95fp rating is 1/9 of that of the 1,000-Pentium machine mentioned above).
One of these human competitive results were obtained
with a 1994-vintage machine (whose spec95fp rating is 1/1,320 of that of the
1,000-Pentium machine mentioned above). The individual processors in the1,000-Pentium machine have (as of July 2003) about 1/8 the
speed of processors contained in commercially available $999 laptops, so that
the 1,000-Pentium machine is approximately equivalent to a 125-processor
machine with 2003-vintage processors.

  The Pickaxe book, named for the tool on the cover, is the definitive reference to Ruby, a highly-regarded, fully object-oriented programming language. This Second Edition has more than 200 pages of new content, and substantial enhancements to the original, covering all the new and improved language features of Ruby 1.8 and standard library modules.


	What Version of Ruby are You Using?


	Ruby is in a period of transition. 2009 saw the release of Ruby 1.9.1, the next generation of the language. Ruby 1.9 has many enhancements and new features that make it the Ruby of choice for new projects. If you want to use Ruby 1.9, then check out our new book Programming Ruby 1.9.


	Alternatively, if you want to continue to use Ruby 1.8, then use the book on this page.

About this Book
Would you like to go from first idea to working code much, much faster? Do you currently spend more time satisfying the compiler instead of your clients or end users? Are you frustrated with demanding languages that seem to get in your way, instead of getting the work done? If so, then we&#8217;ve got a language and book for you!


	Ruby is a fully object-oriented language, much like the classic object-oriented language, Smalltalk. Like Smalltalk, it is dynamically typed (as opposed to Java or C++), but unlike Smalltalk, Ruby features the same conveniences found in modern scripting languages such as Perl and Python.


	The combination of the power of a pure object-oriented language with the convenience of a scripting language makes Ruby a favorite tool of intelligent, forward-thinking programmers.


	The Pickaxe contains four major sections:


	
	An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby.
		The definitive reference to the language.
		Complete documentation of all built-in classes, modules, and methods.
		Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries.
	


	Readers of the First Edition will appreciate the new and expanded content, including: enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Ruby&#8217;s capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the world-wide web is easy in Ruby with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed ruby, templating systems and other web services. There&#8217;s even a new chapter on unit testing.


	This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so programmers can dynamically examine and experiment with running code.


	
	The definitive reference manual for Ruby programmers.
		Up-to-date and expanded for Ruby version 1.8.
		Complete documentation of all built-in classes, modules, and methods.
		Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries.
		200+ pages of new content in this edition.
		NEW: Learn more about Ruby&#8217;s web tools, unit testing, and programming philosophy.

Reader Comments

    
    Ruby is one of those great languages that takes an afternoon to start using, and years (maybe a lifetime) to master. In C, I&#8217;m always having to work around the limitations of the language; in Ruby, I&#8217;m always discovering a neater, cleaner, more efficient way to do things. Programming Ruby is the essential reference to the Ruby language. More than just teaching you the syntax, it teaches you the spirit and the feel of the language.
    &#8212;Ben Giddings
    
    
  
    
    The best reason to learn a new programming language is to learn to think differently. The best way to learn to think the Ruby way is to read Programming Ruby. Several years ago, with the first edition of this book, I did just that. Since then, I&#8217;ve had a constant stream of enjoyable Ruby programming experiences. This is due in no insignificant part to the quality of the source from which I learned the language. I&#8217;m not the only person I&#8217;ve heard say that every language should have a book like this.

    This book changed my life. Sounds rather clich&#8217;ed, but it&#8217;s the truth. After six years and 300,000 lines of Java code, I needed a change. That change occurred upon reading the first edition of this book. With the support of a solid community and ever growing foundation of superb libraries, I founded a company that largely profits from applying Ruby to solve real-world problems. Ruby is ready for primetime, and this new version of the PickAxe will show a waiting world what a gem Ruby really is.

I (Bjarne Stroustrup)
am the designer and original implementor of C++.
You can find the language, the techniques for using it, and the techniques
for implementing it described in my
books,
my
papers,
in hundreds of books by others, and thousands of papers by others.
There are far too many to list.
Try a bookstore or a library.
Answers to many questions about C++ can be found in


my FAQ,

my C++ Style and Technique FAQ

my C++ glossary, and

some interviews that I have given.

The ISO C++ Standard:
C++ is standardized by ISO (The International Standards Organization)
in collaboration with national standards organizations, such as 
ANSI (The American National Standards Institute),
BSI (The British Standards Institute),
DIN (The German national standards organization).
The original C++ standard was issued in 1998, a minor revison in 2003, and the work on the next
standard "C++0x" is nearing completion.

My C++0x FAQ.

The ISO C++ standards committee (WG21) maintains an
official site
with information about the current state of the standards effort.

My book
The Design and Evolution of C++
describes the standards process and many of the design decisions made

will be accepted into C++0x. Here is
the current state of the evolution proposals.

A standard library wishlist
maintained by Matt Austern.

a press release about C++ and its 1998 standard
intended for non-programmers

a press release about the availability of the 1998 standard


The standard is ISO/IEC 14882;
it is available for downloading from the
National Committee for Information Technology Standards Electronic Store.
The cost is (as I write this) US$18.00 payable on-line via credit card.
It is available as a book (on paper): "The C++ Standard", published by Wiley, ISBN 0 470 84674-7.

Discussions about C++ and its use can be found in most forums covering
programming. The usenet groups comp.lang.c++.moderated and
alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ are good examples. These groups can be accessed in
various ways including
Google Groups (sort by date).

                    Hey, something's different here...
		  No, we didn't get contacts or lose a few pounds. But we are looking good, thanks to a new logo and a website redesign. In January 2008 the Portland Oregon Visitors Association officially changed its name to Travel Portland - a name you've seen on our visitor magazine and as part of our website address for the past several years. So, even though our name is new, it has a familiar ring to it. We hope you enjoy our updated look and the redesigned site.

When we walked at the market of Dimeka some women and girls liked to touch our arms and hairs and asked us to touch their hairs. There was a lot of laughter, if our hands or arms became coloured with the red-brown ochre.
